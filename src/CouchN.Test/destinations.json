From touring the Houses of Parliament in London, to climbing\r\nArthur’s Seat in Edinburgh, to being visually stunned by Northern Ireland’s\r\nGiant’s Causeway, to the Catalan delights of Barcelona and the windy coast of\r\nperfect Portugal, there’s something for everyone in Western Europe. &nbsp;It can feel like taking a step back in time as\r\nyou wander the streets of ancient cities, but these countries are full to\r\nbursting with contemporary style and modern living with a continental twist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dublin, Ireland’s capital, has the benefit\r\nof being a compact cosmopolitan city so walking around the center is a fun,\r\neasy way to explore the rich history and culture this city has to offer.&nbsp; It is the perfect place to get to know\r\nIreland but has a great bar culture more akin to its European counterparts, so\r\nthat walking around the city is almost always interspersed with a trip to a\r\ncozy, or trendy pub and a swift half of Guinness to keep your strength up.&nbsp; Temple Bar is the cultural heart of the city\r\nand a great place to wander in in the evenings, but you’ll want to spend time\r\naround the Docklands, enjoying the water and the light during the day and a\r\ntour of Dublin Castle is an absolute must. Teeming with history from as far\r\nback as 1230, Dublin Castle has borne witness to much of Dublin’s difficult\r\npast and fascinating history, from English Rule to Independence you can learn\r\nabout the true heart of Ireland here and come face to face with its past.&nbsp; Parliament House, Trinity College and Christ\r\nChurch Cathedral are all architectural delights not to be passed over in a trip\r\nto this fine city.&nbsp; Cobh (Cork) is\r\nanother stunning Irish town waiting to be explored.&nbsp; With a rich maritime past and history long\r\nconnected to the sea and emigration there is much to be learnt here and a lot\r\nto see and do.&nbsp; There are popular tours\r\nof the harbor which includes a fascinating history lesson on the connecting\r\nCobh has to emigration and particularly Australia as well as the stunning St.\r\nColman’s Cathedral dating back to 1867.&nbsp;\r\nAway from the Republic of Ireland you can learn more about the island’s\r\ntroubled past in Belfast in Northern Ireland, a site for many years of\r\nturbulence and political instability.&nbsp;\r\nLearn about the city’s past at the Ulster Museum and spend time on\r\nSkankhill and Falls Road which have both served as flashpoints in the city\r\nthroughout the city’s troubled history.&nbsp;\r\nTravel even further back in time by visiting Belfast’s Castle built at\r\nthe beginning of the 18<sup>th</sup> century and is set in beautiful landscaped\r\ngardens from which there are stunning views to be appreciated.&nbsp; From Belfast it is also possible to visit the\r\nfamed Giant’s Causeway, one of the most awe inspiring natural wonders in all of\r\nBritain.&nbsp; Formed over 60 million years\r\nago, the natural phenomena of the Causeway was created through volcanic\r\ncrashing and burning, resulting in close to 40,000 basalt columns stretching\r\nout into the sea, but as with great natural phenomena everywhere the locals\r\nhave their own version of how the Giant’s Causeway came into being, which are\r\njust as worth learning about as the science.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scotland and the Scottish are famous for\r\nmany things, but perhaps the most enjoyable and culturally enriching is the\r\ntradition of whisky.&nbsp; When on the\r\nstunning outer Hebrides island of Stornoway visit the Abhainn Dearg Distillery\r\nwhere you can tour the distillery and learn more about the tradition of whisky\r\nand the Scottish skill which goes into making a truly sensational single\r\nmalt.&nbsp; And if you have to test a few to\r\nget a true taste of Scotland, well then that’s just your good luck! Stornoway\r\nis also home to a fascinating circle of standing stones akin to those found at\r\nStonehenge in England.&nbsp; The Callanish\r\nSanding Stones, however, are central to Celtic tradition and history and, being\r\nfar less visited than Stonehenge it is also possible to see them up close.&nbsp; Back on the mainland you can explore the\r\nScottish Highlands from Inverness, a town at the gateway to the stunning\r\nScottish landscape.&nbsp; From here you can\r\nalso visit Loch Ness and search for the infamous ‘monster’.&nbsp; This is a truly stunning part of the world\r\nthat should be first on the list of any traveler who considers themselves a\r\nnature lover and wilderness fan.&nbsp; Perhaps\r\nthe last part of Britain it’s possible to really get lost in, there are of\r\ncourse plenty of hiking and walking opportunities that will allow you to get to\r\nknow the area better, as well as truly appreciate the magic of the\r\nHighlands.&nbsp; Scotland’s capital,\r\nEdinburgh, is a history and architecture lover’s dream; easily explored on\r\nfoot, the cobbled streets and castle on the hill (Arthur’s Seat) are sure to\r\nenchant and charm.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traveling south and into England, many\r\nvacationer’s first stop will of course be the capital city of London, one of\r\nthe most diverse and cosmopolitan cities in the world.&nbsp; With an often torrid and turbulent past, the\r\nhistory of London stretches as far back as the Romans who called the city\r\nLondinium.&nbsp; Widely considered a world\r\ncity, London is one of the most visited in the world and this status as a world\r\ncapital was consolidated in the summer of 2012 when it became the first city to\r\nhost the Summer Olympics three times.&nbsp;\r\nWith a recent past as fascinating as its lengthy history there is much\r\nto be learnt here, but there is also much to be enjoyed from unparalleled\r\nshopping experiences, West End shows, River Thames cruises, some of the world’s\r\nfinest art galleries and museums, exceptional nightlife and a restaurant scene\r\nwidely considered to be at the top of its game.&nbsp;\r\nWith the much more recently built attractions of the Olympic Park,\r\nGreenwich Millennium Dome and London Eye combining with the ancient and much\r\nstoried attractions of Buckingham Palace, Tower of London, the Houses of\r\nParliament and St Paul’s Cathedral there is almost too much to see and do in\r\nthis truly metropolitan city.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another city simply teeming with history,\r\nwith another tit bit about the past just waiting to be discovered around every\r\ncobblestoned corner is Amsterdam, the city of canals to be found in The\r\nNetherlands.&nbsp; Famous (and sometimes\r\ninfamous) for its café culture and red light district, there is much more to\r\nthis picturesque city than meets the eye.&nbsp;\r\nVisit the Anne Frank House and learn about the effects of Nazi\r\noccupation by coming face to face with one of the most famous diarist in the worlds’\r\npast.&nbsp; With a charming compact center,\r\nAmsterdam is a fun and easy place to explore but there are a few unique ways to\r\ndo so such as a canal trip or alternatively, do as the locals do and rent one\r\nof the many bikes which line the streets and discover another side of the city.&nbsp; Antwerp in Belgium is another picturesque\r\ncity to be visited in this part of the world. With a perfectly preserved town\r\ncenter including the famous Grote Markt, or central square this is a great\r\nplace to get to know the medieval architecture particular to this part of\r\nBelgium.&nbsp; The 14<sup>th</sup> century\r\nCathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp is an awe inspiring piece of European\r\narchitecture which tops off a trip to the city perfectly.&nbsp; From the port of Zeebrugge in Belgium it is\r\npossible to visit the perfectly picturesque town of Bruges, famous for its\r\ncanals, medieval architecture and a stunning central square.&nbsp; Tour the town from a canal boat, or take a\r\nhot air balloon ride over the tops of the picture perfect houses and\r\nbuildings.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany has much in the way to recommend\r\nitself to tourists and travelers.&nbsp; With a\r\nhistory as vast, varied and controversial as any other in the world there is\r\nmuch to learn from a country and nation which has almost completely had to\r\nreinvent itself and its identity since the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; Hamburg is a great introduction to the\r\ncountry with a fantastic cultural scene, exuberant energy, and enormous\r\nport.&nbsp; The city’s town hall, or Rathaus\r\nas it’s called in German is a neoclassical architectural dream within the\r\naltstadt (Old City), and serves to remind visitors and locals alike of the\r\npast, present and future and how all three can be healthily intertwined with\r\nverve and integrity.&nbsp; The city’s zoo is\r\none of the best in Europe and well worth a visit considering it has been in\r\nexistence since 1863 and has chosen to house its furry and fuzzy inhabitants in\r\nopen (and yet still safely enclosed) spaces, rather than the more commonly used\r\ncages.&nbsp; Surrounded by land, Berlin is a\r\ndifficult place to get to for cruisers, but it’s a must-see destination for any\r\nEuropean jaunt, especially considering the historic significance of the\r\ncity.&nbsp; From Rostock you can travel onward\r\non land to this newly minted capital of ‘cool’, and enjoy all the eclectic and\r\neccentric offerings, as well as the more traditional side of the city.&nbsp; Visit the Brandenburg Gate, Charlottenburg\r\nCastle, Checkpoint Charlie and the Wall of course, but also make time for\r\nexploring the locals’ favorite haunts of Kreuzburg and Neukölln and sauntering\r\nthrough Prenzlauer Berg or Kollwitzplatz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>France is a country which contains a\r\nmultitude of attractive and alluring tourist attractions, the most famous of\r\nwhich of course being the City of Love and Lights, Paris.&nbsp; From the port city of Le Havre you can expect\r\nto visit this most Romantic of cities, where you can cruise up the Seine, climb\r\nto the top of the Eiffel Tower, explore Monmatre and the Quartier Latin, step\r\nback in time at St Germain du Pres, traverse the beautiful boulevards, shop on\r\nthe Champs Elysee, feel triumphant at the Arc du Triomphe and taste some of the\r\nbest and most famous regional cuisine in the world.&nbsp; Keep it simple with a picnic of <i>baguette et fromage</i> on the shores of the\r\nSeine or go all out with a Michelen starred meal of French classics and a\r\nvintage <i>verre du vin. </i>But the coastal\r\ntowns and cities of France also have much to offer by way of the freshest of\r\nfish, charming atmosphere and warm welcomes, whether on the beaches of Biarritz\r\nor the harbors of La Rochelle and Brest.&nbsp;\r\nBordeaux is the capital of winemaking and the best place to get to know\r\nthe regional specialties as well as the particulars of winemaking.&nbsp; The city too is beautiful and full to the\r\nbrim with history, culture and art as well as with possibilities for wine\r\ntasting around every corner.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heading towards the Iberian Peninsula you can\r\nvisit the rocky shores of Portugal, where surfers ride the best breaks in\r\nEurope at Peniche and Sagres.&nbsp; Lisbon,\r\none of Europe’s most fascinating and yet lesser visited capital cities is an\r\nart lover’s paradise and full to bursting with history and architecture. One of\r\nthe top tourist attractions in the city is the Moorish castle of Sintra Castelo,\r\nan exemplary and decadent display of Moorish design and architecture which\r\nrevels in its eccentricity and colorful façade.&nbsp;\r\nBuilt in the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> centuries, the castle is\r\na UNESCO World Heritage Site and provides sweeping vistas of the city once you\r\nhave climbed to the top.&nbsp; Valencia is\r\nSpain’s third largest city and a great place to start learning about this\r\nfascinating, and often sun drenched country.&nbsp;\r\nThis is a city which delights in beachside living and the good things in\r\nlife, but be sure to explore the center of the town away from the sandy shore\r\nas well for there is a city full of culture, art and history to be found.&nbsp; There is also some world class shopping to be\r\ndone here, with the Mercat Central a particularly popular spot to visit, being\r\nas it is an aesthetically pleasing as well as sartorially inspiring marketplace\r\nand building to spend some time, and probably some money in.&nbsp; Up in the North Eastern corner of Spain, in\r\nthe area of Catalonia lies one of the country’s best loved cities of\r\nBarcelona.&nbsp; Once host to the Summer\r\nOlympics, the city, like Valencia has mastered the art of beachside living combined\r\nwith metropolitan flair.&nbsp; This is truly a\r\ncity in which modernity meets tradition, with stunning architecture, especially\r\nthose made famous by Gaudi such as the Sagrada Familia, Parc Guell, and Casa\r\nBatlo all of which are not to be missed.&nbsp;\r\nStroll down Las Ramblas at morning, noon or midnight and its sure to be\r\nteeming with people, whether locals or visitors, as this is the heart of this\r\nstunning city.&nbsp; Be sure to try the\r\nregional specials of tapas and hot chocolate or churros beloved of tourists and\r\ncity natives alike.&nbsp; There are a myriad of\r\ncultural hot spots to hit in Barcelona, but one of the very best has to be the\r\nMiro Museum which houses some of the finest pieces of work by one of the 20<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury’s most important artists, so be sure not to miss out.&nbsp; Exploring Western Europe you’ll feel like\r\nAladdin exploring his cave full of treasures, and will be sure to leave both\r\ninspired, and happily tired by the sheer wealth of cultural and historical\r\ntreasures on offer in what is, for good reason, one of the most visited and\r\nbest-loved parts of the world.&nbsp;</p></p><p></p>\r\n","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"f6b989f7-7ef3-405d-80ef-e3c2faccd773","Slug":"a-movable-feast-by-ernest-hemingway","Title":"A Movable

History also abounds in\r\nthe historical town of St George which was declared a UNESCO world heritage\r\nsite in 2000.&nbsp; The town is well worth a\r\nvisit when staying on the island, even for those less interested in the\r\nhistorical side of life, as it is a truly picturesque town with some rather\r\nunique architecture as well as a buzzy and bustling island atmosphere.&nbsp; The title of the island’s capital was lost to\r\nHamilton in 1815, however, which is also a city that deserves a visit or two,\r\nbut for many St George remains the most charming. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For golf enthusiasts, Bermuda holds the\r\ntitle of the most golf courses on any one island in the world, with seven world\r\nclass courses in just 22 acres.&nbsp; There is\r\nmuch more to the experience of golfing on Bermuda, of course, and with fairways\r\nappearing to disappear off over cliffs that plunge down into twinkling\r\nturquoise waters, you’ll have to be careful not to get too distracted by all\r\nthe natural beauty that is on offer in abundance.&nbsp; There are also plenty of water, and\r\nunderwater sports to keep you busy and active, from world class diving\r\nopportunities to parasailing, water skiing, and guided sea kayaking through the\r\nisland’s secretive and hidden coves.&nbsp;\r\nThere are nature reserves to visit, dolphins to meet and swim with, and\r\ncaves to explore and marvel at.&nbsp; But if\r\nyou want to just sit and relax on one of the many pink hued beaches whilst admiring\r\nthe crystal turquoise waters lapping at your feet, with a dark n’ stormy in\r\nhand, well then that’s okay too.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"47e9a13e-7f30-4b39-8bf0-008e722dd5bc","Slug":"an-embarrassment-of-mangoes-by-ann-vanderhoof","Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes","Author":"Ann Vanderhoof","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:35:36.5104897Z"},{"Id":"6ae5af8d-d91a-4bdc-b474-ce11f376b376","Slug":"any-human-heart-by-william-boyd","Title":"Any Human Heart","Author":"William Boyd","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:35:39.3016493Z"},{"Id":"260ffe06-d205-44c5-bb4a-1420ad4d1f56","Slug":"bermuda-schwartz-by-bob-morris","Title":"Bermuda Schwartz","Author":"Bob Morris","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:35:42.6228393Z"},{"Id":"11d11e52-83dc-4b60-9e7b-f0f6b636660c","Slug":"bermuda-shorts-the-hidden-side-of-the-richest-place-on-earth-by-t-c-sobey","Title":"Bermuda Shorts: The Hidden Side of the Richest Place on Earth","Author":"T.C.

On the idiosyncratic island you can also expect to witness Sally\r\nLightfoot Crabs, the famous Marine Iguanas and Galapagos Sea Lions which are\r\nslightly smaller than the California Sea Lion and who have been known to be extremely\r\nfriendly towards tourists and visitors.&nbsp;\r\nAs well as indigenous fauna, there are also several varieties of endemic\r\nflora, such as the Scalesia tree, Brachycereus cactus and the Prickly Pear\r\nCactus.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are particular spots in the Galapagos\r\narchipelago in which to see rare, endangered and indigenous bird life,\r\nincluding Tower Island which is extremely low lying and an almost magical place\r\nto visit, not just because of the supreme bird watching opportunities but\r\nbecause it is so often shrouded in a mist rendering it almost completely\r\ninvisible to the human eye.&nbsp; From this\r\nsmall island you can view Red-footed and Masked Boobies, Wedge-rumped Storm\r\nPetrels, Swallow-tailed Gulls, Lava Gulls, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Large Ground\r\nFinches, Sharp-beaked Ground Finches, Cactus Finches, Warbler Finches, Yellow\r\nWarblers, Galapagos Mockingbirds, Galapagos Doves, and Yellow-crowned Night\r\nHerons.&nbsp; This would be the opportunity of\r\na lifetime for any bird lover, but will also humble any keen nature lover and\r\ntraveler and is sure to make the top 5 in the travel experiences of any\r\nwell-traveled tourist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back on the mainland, Ecuador has as much\r\nto recommend itself as the Galapagos.&nbsp; One\r\nof the favored spots of tourists looking for a little relaxed beach time is the\r\ntown of Manta which may be one of the largest ports in the country but still\r\nmaintains a laid back vacation&nbsp; vibe,\r\nespecially at the many beaches which surround the port city such as San Lorenzo\r\nand El Murciélago.&nbsp; Both of these\r\npicturesque, white sand beaches are popular with tourists both from within and\r\noutside of Ecuador and, therefore, cater to a healthy tourist trade.&nbsp; Restaurants, cafes and bars line the beach\r\nfront at El Murcielago, whilst San Lorenzo offers a different kind of beach\r\nexperience, with interesting rock formations, the opportunity to see\r\nblue-footed boobies and sometimes even humpback whales, as well as the Island\r\nof the Silver.&nbsp; Guayaquil is busier and\r\nmore bustling than Manta, and is the largest city in Ecuador although it is not\r\nthe capital.&nbsp; With beautiful old colonial\r\nbuildings in the center, large expanses of parks, including the famous Parque\r\nde las Iguanas and the brilliantly restored and wonderfully colorful old town,\r\nLas Peñas, there is much to see and do here.&nbsp;\r\nJourneying into the interior of the country is worth it for a visit to\r\nthe exceptional capital city of Quito.&nbsp;\r\nThe magnificent colonial center of the old town is a UNESCO World\r\nHeritage Site, with picturesque buildings lining streets and squares simply\r\nbegging to be caught on camera.&nbsp; Having\r\nundergone a huge restoration project, the city has found a new sense of pride\r\nin its architectural gems; buildings which stand proudly attesting to the\r\ncountry’s past and looking towards a particularly bright future.&nbsp; The city is also set within a stunning valley\r\nin the Andes, flanked by snow-capped mountains and at 2,800 meters above sea\r\nlevel it also one of the highest capital cities in the world, so although\r\nyou’re sure to have a few breath taking moments wandering its cobblestoned\r\nstreets and marveling at its markets, be sure you’re not also suffering from\r\naltitude sickness!&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cartagena in Colombia is one of the oldest\r\nand most historically significant cities in South America.&nbsp; Having been settled long before Europeans\r\ncame to colonize the area, Cartagena’s history stretches back to around 4000\r\nB.C. although the city as it exists now was settled by the Spanish in\r\n1533.&nbsp; The walled city is a UNESCO World\r\nHeritage Site and a good place to start a tour of this fine, ancient port\r\ncity.&nbsp; The Old City is steeped in ancient\r\nhistory and dotted with attractive cafes serving up famously delicious\r\nColombian coffee.&nbsp; The Plaza del Bolivar\r\nand Cartagena are both major draws for tourists, and rightly so, but a walk\r\nalong the old fortifications is a great way to get to know the city as well,\r\nwith sweepingly majestic views of both the city and the Caribbean Sea.&nbsp; The main beaches aren’t too far a walk from\r\nthe city walls, and provide brilliant relaxation in stunning surroundings after\r\na tour of the town.&nbsp; The shopping and\r\nepicurean possibilities in Cartagena are endless, and the open air shopping\r\nplaza, Pierino Gallo, is the perfect place to peruse the stores; especially as\r\nit just happens to be the largest emerald retailer in the world.&nbsp; Away from the hustle and bustle of Cartagena\r\nis Santa Marta on Colombia’s Costa Norte.&nbsp;\r\nHere, white sand beaches stretch out into the distance and the Tayrona\r\nNational Park extends right up to the shore.&nbsp;\r\nExplore the park at your leisure, including the charming crescent\r\nbeaches, and incredible surf before settling down to a well-earned meal at El\r\nEspañolete which specializes in Spanish dishes including Paella and can found\r\nin a beautiful, old colonial building in the town.</p></p><p></p>\r\n","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"631b37c3-cf4a-4229-8150-f72072dd909b","Slug":"angels-of-maradona-by-glen-carter","Title":"Angels of

But be\r\nsure not to miss out on lapping up some of Russia’s most on-trend movements for\r\nfashion, food and culture, for in city in which the past is preserved so\r\nbeautifully it’s easy to forget how contemporary and forward looking its\r\ncitizens are.&nbsp; Two other cities in Russia\r\nwhich offer opposing views of this varied country are Novorossiysk in the south\r\non the shores of the Black Sea, where Russians like to summer and Murmansk in\r\nthe north which is the only city above the Arctic Circle.&nbsp; Novorossiysk simmers with Ancient Greek\r\nheritage and shimmers with the beauty of the Black Sea on a summer’s day whilst\r\nMurmansk displays its folkloric heritage proudly, with foraging festivals and\r\nan excellent Museum of Regional Studies.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riga is Latvia’s capital city a busy\r\nbustling place with as much stunning architecture as St Petersburg, on a more\r\npedestrian friendly scale.&nbsp; The best way\r\nto experience Riga is on foot, wandering the simply stunning Old Town which is\r\nthe site of more than one UNESCO World Heritage Site.&nbsp; Brimming with German Art Nouveau\r\narchitecture, the buildings themselves tell the story of a city and country\r\nembedded with fascinating history which has been embroiled in some of the most\r\nfascinating events of the past century.&nbsp;\r\nHaving suffered in both the Second World War and the immediate aftermath\r\nwith Soviet takeover, there is no denying that Latvia has had its fair share of\r\ntragedy, but the city’s citizens show great strength with facing the future\r\nwith optimism and verve, as well as honoring their past with such beautiful\r\npreservation of the city’s architectural history.&nbsp; This is a city which lives and breathes\r\nhistory, where you can be served coffee in an architectural gem or grab a drink\r\nin a Jugendstil, but be sure not to miss out on the Historic House of the\r\nBlackheads which also houses the tourist office, or the majestic St. Peter’s\r\nChurch which dates back to 1209, despite being a mismatch of Romanesque, Gothic\r\nand Baroque architecture.&nbsp; At the heart\r\nof Tallinn, Estonia’s regal capital city, is Toompea Castle, a medieval citadel\r\non a hill which overlooks the rest of the attractive cityscape.&nbsp; Winding up towards this great fortress are\r\nthe cobble stoned streets of the Old Town betraying the medieval roots of this\r\nfine city.&nbsp; Like Riga in Latvia, both the\r\ncountry and the city have had more than their fair share of history, much of it\r\ndifficult and controversial, but Tallinn dates back as far as 1154 and is,\r\ntherefore, the oldest capital city in Northern Europe and it wears its history,\r\nage, and heart on its sleeve like a badge of honor.&nbsp; With St. Olav’s Church and Tower, the Town\r\nHall Square and Alexander Nevski Cathedral to visit, which range from the 13<sup>th</sup>\r\nto the 19<sup>th</sup> century there is much of note packed into this small\r\ncity.&nbsp; But there is a young heart to this\r\nobviously aged city as well and you’ll find it in its legendary bars and\r\nnightclubs which make it one of Europe’s biggest and most popular nightlife\r\nhotspots.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Lithuania Klaipėda may not be the\r\nnation’s capital but it is a brilliant place to start exploring this beautiful\r\nBaltic country.&nbsp; With historic buildings\r\nand artifacts aplenty, Klaipėda has as much history as Riga and Tallinn but is\r\na much quieter city in which to get to know the past and present of these\r\nBaltic states.&nbsp; Here you can honor the\r\nJewish dead who were dealt a tragic blow first by Nazi occupation during WWII\r\nand then during Soviet rule when all their cemeteries were ruined and razed and\r\nthere is now a memorial in place of such cemeteries to pay respects.&nbsp; You may want to get away from the city’s\r\nhustle and bustle after such a visit, and a great way to blow away the cobwebs\r\nand catch your breath is with a walk in The Kuršių Nerija National Park, which\r\ncomprises the spit and narrow stretch of dune that divides the Curonian Lagoon\r\nfrom the Baltic Sea.&nbsp; Gdansk, formerly\r\nknown as Danzig, is one of the most important ports in Poland and with a\r\nhistory as long and varied as that of either Riga or Tallinn it is a great city\r\nto spend time in and get to know both Poland and the Baltics.&nbsp; A highly influential port of great seafaring\r\nsignificance during the Medieval and Renaissance periods, it went on to be a\r\nhighly importance city during the Second World War as well. The city has its\r\nroots in the depths of history, having, it is believed, to have been originally\r\nfounded in the 980s when Mieszko I of Poland built a stronghold.&nbsp; Sightseeing in this port city is, therefore,\r\na lesson in Polish and Baltic history in and of itself, and is helped by the\r\nfact that it is truly stunning and has had the benefit of being beautifully\r\nrestored since being damaged during WWII.&nbsp;\r\nSo beautiful and well maintained is Gdansk that it can feel like a\r\nliving museum, which in a part of the world so saturated and rich in\r\nfascinating history cannot be a bad thing.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"a94e7a78-3a10-47cd-a1a8-892bc0b25770","Slug":"anna-karenina-by-leo-tolstoy","Title":"Anna Karenina","Author":"Leo Tolstoy","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:45:39.6509874Z"},{"Id":"8868d96e-9e9f-46b7-9203-229fd497fd20","Slug":"between-shades-of-grey-by-ruta-sepetys-with-dance-shoes-in-siberian-snow-by-sandra-kalniete","Title":"Between Shades of Grey by Ruta Sepetys;  With Dance Shoes in Siberian Snow","Author":"Sandra Kalniete","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:45:42.6881611Z"},{"Id":"31102e57-c735-403f-a90d-ad855e53619d","Slug":"crime-and-punishment-by-fyodor-dostoyevsky","Title":"Crime and Punishment","Author":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:45:46.1213574Z"},{"Id":"47b39a31-bab2-41f8-a7d0-1985b880ace3","Slug":"dancer-by-colum-mccann","Title":"Dancer","Author":"Colum McCann","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:45:49.3925445Z"},{"Id":"2e57ce2e-ff0a-4abd-8ca0-9e78a22836ba","Slug":"eugene-onegin-by-alexander-pushkin","Title":"Eugene Onegin","Author":"Alexander Pushkin","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:45:52.424718Z"},{"Id":"604780e4-a911-4903-b9c6-bd4c28da112b","Slug":"fall-of-giants-by-ken-follett","Title":"Fall of Giants","Author":"Ken Follett","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:45:55.712906Z"},{"Id":"51ac4177-d62c-4cef-b282-73eadb69e0b2","Slug":"hunger-by-elise-blackwell","Title":"Hunger","Author":"Elise Blackwell","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:45:59.0920993Z"},{"Id":"c09d5cab-c8e3-4217-bd4a-378a52965e34","Slug":"peter-the-great-by-robert-k-massie","Title":"Peter the Great","Author":"Robert K.

Caicos and the Dominican\r\nRepublican.&nbsp; For many, the allure of\r\nthese islands is less developed nature of them, as well the customary stretches\r\nof white sand beaches and turquoise sea that everyone expects from a trip to\r\nthe Caribbean.&nbsp; The islands sit just east\r\nand south of Cuba, and display the vast array in natural beauty and bounty as\r\nwell as the diverse cultures and traditions on offer throughout the\r\nCaribbean.&nbsp; By and large they are far\r\nless built up, or built for tourism in the way that the more historically\r\npopular islands such as Bermuda and the Bahamas are.&nbsp; As a visitor to the Eastern Caribbean you are\r\nable to partake in the fantasy of the Caribbean, to live the dream of life on a\r\nparadisiacal island, but with the added benefit of being far from the maddening\r\ncrowd; exploring unknown, but just as beautiful terrain.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turks and Caicos hold an almost magical\r\nplace in many Caribbean visitors’ minds, being as they are such a perfect\r\nvision of the kind of tropical sanctuary holidaymakers dream of from busy\r\noffices and on cold trains as they plough through the winter working week.&nbsp; Turks and Caicos is a kind of paradise;\r\nundeveloped, but upscale; popular but not busy; a lovingly curated sense of\r\ntradition coupled with a forward looking attitude.&nbsp; There is plenty to do on Turks and Caicos,\r\nincluding whale watching during the January to May season, particularly off the\r\nshore of Salt Cay, a visit to the historical plantation of Cheshire Hall on\r\nProvidenciales, which is also home to the Caribbean’s best golf course, visits\r\nto the famous conch farms, and a fascinating learning experience when kayaking\r\nin a clear bottom kayak through the saltmarshes and mangroves of Grand Turk.&nbsp; But there is no denying that the greatest\r\nallure of Turks and Caicos is the promise of a hidden, secretive, paradisiacal\r\nisland sanctuary providing the holy trinity of sun, sea, and sand, but the with\r\nthe added bonus of being a little further off the beaten track than usual and,\r\ntherefore, serene, relaxing and rejuvenating, almost in the extreme.&nbsp; Grand Turk, less developed than the tourist\r\ncenter of Providenciales, is the island to head for if in search of such\r\nbeachside bliss.&nbsp; There are, of course,\r\ngrand opportunities galore for world class scuba diving and snorkeling, as well\r\nas the chance to explore a truly unique cave network on Middle Caicos. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Virgin Islands also provide an\r\nopportunity to explore a more secluded, less built up side of the Caribbean,\r\nwith many searching for such seclusion starting with the smallest island of the\r\ntrio, St John, where tranquility and restorative beaches are the name of the\r\ngame.&nbsp; Fans of hiking and walking will\r\nalso have plenty to do on this charming island, but for many the real draw is\r\nthe promise of some peace and quiet, coupled with an artistic outlook and\r\nburgeoning art scene.&nbsp; St John is\r\nsomething of an artistic community, providing a retreat for artists from not\r\nonly the more frenetic energy of the US mainland, but also the more built up\r\nnature of other Caribbean islands.&nbsp; St\r\nCroix, and St Thomas, the two other main islands in the archipelago are fine\r\npurveyors of history and culture, and display this proudly in various museums\r\nand galleries, including the Camille Pisarro Gallery on St Thomas which\r\ndisplays some of the works, and reveals the history of the great Impressionist\r\nartist who was born and raised in Charlotte Amalie.&nbsp; You can also visit the Caribbean Museum\r\nCentre on St Croix, and witness the regeneration of various historically\r\nimportant Danish buildings from the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century\r\nin Frederiksted on the island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other stops in the Eastern Caribbean\r\ntypically include the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola, Puerto\r\nRico, St Kitts, the British Virgin Islands, and Antigua and Barbuda.&nbsp; All islands offer the verdant and vibrant\r\nbeauty found elsewhere in the Caribbean, as well as the change of pace, and\r\n‘life in the slow lane’ laid back attitude that many visitors to the area are\r\nactively seeking out.&nbsp; The Dominican\r\nRepublic is a truly fascinating country to spend time in with an historical\r\npast as rocky as many of the island’s visually stunning sheer cliff faces.&nbsp; The island’s physical and geographical\r\ndiversity is a wonder to explore and behold, with much of the interior rural,\r\nforested, and by-and-large unexplored by the majority of visitors to the\r\narea.&nbsp; This is not to say that there are\r\nnot ample and easy ways in which to explore this lush vegetation.&nbsp; The rural interior is incredibly fertile, as\r\nyou might expect, but perhaps more surprising is that four out of the five highest\r\npeaks in the Caribbean can be found in the DR, creating an awe inspiring\r\ndistraction for any all-terrain loving hikers and explorers.&nbsp; As with much of the Caribbean, food and drink\r\nis a key part of the country’s culture, with cuisine taking center stage in the\r\ncapital of Santo Domingo.&nbsp; The capital is\r\na cosmopolitan city, on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean, a city which revels in\r\nits diversity, respects its past, is the home of the oldest church in the New\r\nWorld, has borne witness to most of the country’s difficult history and yet\r\nmanages to maintain a warm, welcoming, and laid back attitude and vibrant and\r\ninfectiously celebratory spirit.&nbsp; Any\r\nvisit to this charming and characterful city is sure to change you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Known locally as Isla del Encanto, or “Island\r\nof Enchantment”, Puerto Rico holds much to enchant and charm for visitors to\r\nits welcoming shores.&nbsp; Sat just east of\r\nthe Dominican Republican, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory which recently voted\r\nin favor of statehood in the 2012 election.&nbsp;\r\nIt uses US currency, and it is not necessary for travelers from the US\r\nto enter with a passport.&nbsp; All this, and\r\nmuch much more makes Puerto Rico an extremely attractive destination for\r\nAmerican visitors to the Caribbean, although the island prides itself on being\r\na site of exploration and relaxation for visitors from all over the world.&nbsp; With a history stretching back to 2,000 B.C.\r\nwhen the island was first inhabited, and encompassing the ‘discovery’ by\r\nChristopher Columbus in 1493, the Spanish-American war culminating in the\r\nisland being brought under American control in 1898, and the very recent vote\r\non statehood, it is unsurprisingly a hot topic on the island, and amongst both\r\nlocals and travelers in the area.&nbsp; There\r\nhas been a concerted effort made by the people of Puerto Rico to honor all\r\naspects of the island’s history, and it would only be right as a visitor to\r\ntheir fine and beautiful country to do the same.&nbsp; Visit one of the indigenous parks which have\r\nbeen preserved for history and posterity as a way to ensure the remembrance of\r\nthe island’s existence and inhabitants in the days before Columbus.&nbsp; Be sure also to take the time to properly\r\nenjoy and explore the many historical sites the island is home to, including\r\nthe fortress of Castillo San Felipe del Morro, or ‘El Morro’ as it’s known\r\nlocally which dates back to the 16<sup>th</sup> century, as well as the 18<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury Castillo San Cristobal.&nbsp; In fact\r\nthe island positively heaves with history and historical artifacts and\r\nbuildings.&nbsp; The Hacienda Buena Vista, however,\r\nis a must-visit especially for any coffee fiends to the island, as it is a\r\nperfectly restored 19<sup>th</sup> century coffee plantation.&nbsp; &nbsp;And\r\nlest we forget the importance of a little coastal R&amp;R when it comes to\r\nvisiting the Caribbean, Puerto Rico is famous for its 300 beaches; that’s\r\nalmost 270 miles of beach in an area almost as big as the state of\r\nConnecticut!&nbsp; There is even the\r\nopportunity to surf in Puerto Rico, known as it is as the “Hawaii of the\r\nAtlantic” this may come as a surprise to travelers more used to the calm waters\r\nof the Caribbean Sea.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where many travelers to the Caribbean are\r\ndrawn towards the white sand beaches of their dream Paradise, St Kitts harbors\r\njust the opposite; black sand beaches. Dieppe Beach and Pump Bay are just two\r\nexamples of where the volcanic rock deposits which make the sand black can be\r\nseen. This is not to say, of course, that the pristine white beaches the\r\nCaribbean is famous for cannot be found on St Kitts; quite the contrary in\r\nfact, there are white sand beaches galore, particularly on the Atlantic side of\r\nthe island.&nbsp; St Kitts, like much of the\r\nEastern Caribbean, is less well known than other islands, and benefits from\r\nbeing both secluded and unspoiled.&nbsp;\r\nTestament to this is the untouched rainforest which is, in fact growing,\r\nsomething very few rainforests can lay to, as well as the promise of as-yet\r\nundiscovered dive sites, and the exploration of the National Park which\r\ncomprises a quarter of the land that St Kitts sits on.&nbsp; At odds with the island’s peaceful present is\r\nthe rather more troubled past.&nbsp; Like much\r\nof the rest of the Eastern Caribbean, St Kitts has a far from tranquil history,\r\none which is waiting to be discovered at various educational and fascinating\r\nhistorical sites, set in some of the island’s most beautiful spots.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those looking for an island paradise,&nbsp; complete with rest, relaxation, rejuvenation,\r\nsun, sea and sand could do worse than staying in the British Virgin Islands or\r\nAntigua and Barbuda. Both offer a bona fide island paradise experience, from\r\nthe pristine white sand beaches, to the turquoise, crystal clear waters which\r\nlap at them, to the island cuisine of fresh fish and more fresh fish, and the\r\nvibrant island spirit so often missing from our everyday lives.&nbsp; There is plenty to do and distract in both cases,\r\nif that is what you’re searching for, from excellent diving opportunities, to\r\ncharted catamarans, and jet skiing, as well as the bustling capital of Antigua\r\nSt John’s.&nbsp; With a different beach for\r\neveryday of the year on Antigua, there’s enough here to keep you busy for a\r\ngood long while, but being busy isn’t exactly why people come the Eastern\r\nCaribbean; so grab a cold beer, a good book, and head down to the beach.</p></p><p></p>\r\n","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"cb523eca-015f-4091-8966-12585c66b7ca","Slug":"a-deadly-silver-sea-by-bob-morris","Title":"A Deadly Silver Sea","Author":"Bob Morris","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:40:58.0858828Z"},{"Id":"2c33edaf-13b1-46cf-ba96-8052cf6abba6","Slug":"an-embarrassment-of-mangoes-by-ann-vanderhoof","Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes","Author":"Ann Vanderhoof","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:41:01.1030553Z"},{"Id":"d9da8ce8-4d9a-455a-aabb-185dfa55aff1","Slug":"cereus-blooms-at-night-by-shani-mootoo","Title":"Cereus Blooms at Night","Author":"Shani Mootoo","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:41:03.860213Z"},{"Id":"70ed0917-2253-4e97-bfca-99a5d0cd01fb","Slug":"islands-in-the-stream-by-ernest-hemingway","Title":"Islands in the Stream","Author":"Ernest Hemingway","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:41:06.7403778Z"},{"Id":"58c314ae-eeeb-41bf-ba28-f0ca7f0e6374","Slug":"pirates-by-celia-rees","Title":"Pirates!","Author":"Celia Rees","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:41:09.6085418Z"},{"Id":"b05bc298-dafe-4160-b1f7-345822383380","Slug":"the-brief-wondrous-life-of-oscar-wao-by-junot-diaz","Title":"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao","Author":"Junot Diaz","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:41:12.8027245Z"},{"Id":"002e7634-91c0-44d5-8ba3-58ea02508290","Slug":"the-rum-diary-by-hunter-s-thompson","Title":"The Rum Diary","Author":"Hunter S.

Then the\r\nSouth Pacific and its shimmering, shining, idyllic islands are for you.&nbsp; Fiji has been famous amongst travelers and\r\nvacationers in search of an island paradise for a while now, and for good\r\nreason, fulfilling as it does every single visitor’s dreams of white sand\r\nbeaches, an atmosphere so laid back it could be described as comatose, cocktails\r\nand coconuts a-plenty and the most crystal clear turquoise waters ever\r\nseen.&nbsp; Viti Levu and Vanua Levu are the\r\ntwo largest of the paradisiacal islands and form the main hub of local\r\nactivity, and a trip to either of these islands will provide some indication on\r\nwhat life is like for modern Fijians.&nbsp;\r\nBut away from them it soon becomes abundantly clear that tourism are the\r\nislands main industry; luxury resorts dominate and it’s all about indulging in\r\n‘Fiji time’ where everything is slower, more relaxed and completely based\r\naround the idea of enjoyment and taking your time.&nbsp; Away from the main towns on Viti Levu and\r\nVanua Levu you can explore the hot springs on Vanua Levu in the town of Savusavu\r\nwhere the Hot Springs Hotel provides luxurious treatments as well as indulgent\r\namenities.&nbsp; Step in, take a soak, and\r\nfeel all your troubles begin to drift away.&nbsp;\r\nSavusavu is also a great place for diving enthusiasts, or even for\r\ndiving beginners who wish to discover the underwater wonders of the South\r\nPacific such as wrecked ships and coral reefs.&nbsp;\r\nFiji has been dubbed the ‘soft coral capital of the world’ and this is\r\nthe best spot in the islands to experience it, as well as the various\r\nunderwater creatures such as hammerhead sharks, and a magical myriad of fish\r\nlife.&nbsp; Back on dry land head to the\r\nfamous Copra Shed Marina, a humming marine hub teeming with local color, great\r\nrestaurants and beautiful boutiques.&nbsp;\r\nIt’s the perfect picturesque spot in which to enjoy a sundowner cocktail\r\nwhilst surveying the seaside scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French Polynesia is the most luxurious,\r\nupmarket and most seductive of the South Pacific islands.&nbsp; Oozing old Hollywood glamor and reveling in\r\nits European ambience, Tahiti as it is often known (for its largest and most\r\nfamous island), is the destination for the rich, the famous, and the\r\npampered.&nbsp; Just uttering the name of Bora\r\nBora conjures up images of basking beauties, buffed bathing bodies and\r\nbeautiful stretches of secluded beach.&nbsp;\r\nThis is exactly the place to come if you want your R&amp;R to come with\r\na side of luxury, pampering and glamor.&nbsp;\r\nA lush tropical island of steamy rainforest and idyllic, pristine\r\nbeaches, Bora Bora likes to intrigue, seduce, beguile and spellbind its\r\nvisitors with its dedication not only to aesthetic, natural beauty but also to luxurious\r\nliving.&nbsp; If all that luxury leaves you\r\nwith a little energy to burn it might be a good idea to head on over to Moorea,\r\nanother of French Polynesia’s popular island idylls.&nbsp; Here you can expect to encounter dolphins\r\nwith who you can swim, take in a little local color and heritage at the Tiki\r\nTheater Village where you will witness the traditional Tahitian dance, and hike\r\nto Belvedere Lookout which provides sensational and stunning panoramic vistas\r\nof Opunohu Valley.&nbsp; Be sure also to spend\r\nsome time of French Polynesia’s ‘Sacred Island’, Raiatea which has a long and\r\nfascinating history, as well as luscious tropical vegetation, majestic green\r\nclad mountains and a vanilla plantation which provides excellent, educative\r\ninsight into one of the islands’ main exports and industries.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s more to luxury travel and pampering\r\nspa days in Vanautu.&nbsp; This is a string of\r\nislands which delights in its eccentricities, revels in its unique tourist\r\ndestination spots and plays host to hundreds of happy sun seekers every\r\nyear.&nbsp; This is an island idyll with a\r\ntwist and will be sure not to disappoint anyone who aims to make it their own\r\npersonal paradise for a few days.&nbsp;\r\nThere’s plenty of cultural heritage on display to keep the culture\r\nvultures as happy as the sun seekers here, such as in Champagne Bay where you\r\ncan undertake an enlightening and educational cultural tour of many of the\r\nlocal villages.&nbsp; Add to that the stunning\r\ntrek to the Blue Lagoon, where you will be rewarded by one of the most\r\npicturesque swimming holes in the world and the huge shipwrecks just off the\r\ncoast that are perfect for keen divers and you’ve got a brilliant island destination\r\nas full of action and adventure as it is of palm trees, coconuts, pristine\r\nbeaches and the odd cocktail or two.&nbsp; &nbsp;The buzzing capital of Vanautu which is on the\r\ngorgeously luscious island of Efate, Port Vila is the most popular spot for\r\ntourists and vacationers in the country but it is sure never to feel crowded or\r\ntoo busy.&nbsp; Like Champagne Bay Efate\r\nstrikes just the right balance between laid-back, relaxed island idyll and\r\nadventure-seeking, adrenaline junkie that any beach bum is sure to enjoy.&nbsp; If what you really want is to spend all your\r\ndays sipping cool beers or fruity cocktails under the cool shade of a palm tree\r\nwhilst swinging in a hammock and surveying the earthly paradise which is laid\r\nout in front of you, then you can do just that.&nbsp;\r\nBut if you want to occasionally look up from your book long enough to\r\ndive into local island life, or to explore the sensational Mele Cascades or\r\ndive the incredible coral reefs and half hidden shipwrecks then you are able to\r\ndo so.&nbsp; The island of Efate is also a\r\ngourmand’s paradise, with dozens of gourmet restaurants scattered over the\r\nisland, each with its own private view of the turquoise lagoon which surrounds\r\nthe island, reaching out towards the darker blue of the ocean on the horizon.&nbsp; Sup on seafood, feast on locally reared beef,\r\nsip organically grown coffee and take an epicurean adventure through the finest\r\ncuisine these islands have to offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Caledonia, like French Polynesia blends\r\na distinctively European and French ambience with the laid-back vibe of the\r\nSouthern Pacific islands, but also manages to combine the cosmopolitan with the\r\nisland idyll the South Pacific is known for.&nbsp;\r\nExperience the heady, bustling rush of the city in Noumea where chic\r\nboutiques rub shoulders with Chinatown’s aromatically smelling restaurants and\r\nfine dining opportunities abound as you wander the streets of this exciting\r\nisland city.&nbsp; Away from the vibrant\r\nstreets of Noumea indulge yourself with a swimming trip to the world’s largest\r\ncoral lagoon on Grand Terre or head to the romantic landscape of Iles des\r\nPines, which seems a world away from the lush tropical rainforest of other\r\nPacific islands with its forests of pine reaching down to the shore where\r\npristine white sand meets azure blue waters.&nbsp;\r\nHere you can take a trip to the tranquil and beautiful Our Lady of\r\nAssumption Church which was built in 1860 and was built with a number of\r\ndifferent types of wood, making it a unique and uniquely New Caledonian\r\narchitectural beauty.&nbsp; The Island is also\r\nhome to an intricate network of eerie caves which you can visit, such as Queen\r\nHortense’s Cave, a sacred location where as local lore tells it, the former\r\nQueen Hortense hid in 1883 before abdicating.&nbsp;\r\nAfter such cultural adventuring, be sure to take a well-earned Champagne\r\nboat door around the picturesque island in one of the many outriggers which dot\r\nthe horizon, followed by a local feast of specialties and delicacies such as\r\nfish and fruit cooked over hot stones wrapped in banana leaves; an absolute\r\nmust for the epicurious in the party.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other spots in this idyllic part of the\r\nworld that you are likely to visit and not going to want to miss are Tonga\r\nwhere you can spend time in Tongatapu which is home to the fascinating Tonga\r\nCultural Center as well as the spectacular Mapu’a a’Vaea Blowholes, which issue\r\nforth a fountain of water from coral reefs, promising to shock, surprise and\r\nawe you.&nbsp; The Pitcairn Islands are a\r\nsecluded formation of four small islands where you can dive or swim in the\r\nstunningly clear, turquoise waters of Bounty Bay or learn more about the area\r\nthe Island Museum where you can learn more about the earliest settlers of the\r\nPolynesian Islands, not just the Pitcairns.&nbsp;\r\nThis is also a great place to take a hike, with many choosing to make\r\nChristians’ Cave the destination, thereby combining a leisurely hike with one\r\nof the islands’ main tourist attractions.&nbsp;\r\nRarotonga is the biggest and most frequently visited of the Cook Islands\r\nand with its crystal clear waters, wide secluded beaches and friendly, warm\r\nwelcome it is easy to see why.&nbsp; There are\r\nexcellent diving opportunities here as well as the famous botanical gardens\r\nwhich displays some of the islands’ wide variety of plant life.&nbsp; If none of this tickles your fancy then maybe\r\na horseback ride along the white sand of one of the island’s many white sandy\r\nbeaches at sunset, followed by a refreshing glass of wine or sumptuous cocktail\r\nand stunning five course meal will do the trick.&nbsp; The South Pacific Islands are home to a\r\nvariety of truly excellent activities, many of which will get your adrenaline\r\npumping, your camera snapping, and your heart racing in awe and wonder, but if\r\nit all gets a bit much its worthwhile to remember what most people come here\r\nfor; sun, sea, sand and a taste of island luxury and an idyll worthy of the\r\ncaption ‘paradise’.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"73519a82-b94d-401b-b12f-b38dab576da5","Slug":"fiji-a-novel-by-lance-morcan","Title":"Fiji: A Novel","Author":"Lance Morcan","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"imran.ahmed@cruise.me","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-20T21:42:46.0781059Z"},{"Id":"f3f99eed-2d0d-4a57-a56d-730449200f5a","Slug":"in-the-heart-of-the-sea-the-tragedy-of-the-whaleship-essex-by-nathaniel-philbrick","Title":"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex","Author":"Nathaniel Philbrick","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"imran.ahmed@cruise.me","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-20T21:39:48.6125059Z"},{"Id":"adf0064f-df41-48f1-9120-9bad7c6d2c26","Slug":"mutiny-on-the-bounty-by-charles-bernard-nordhoff","Title":"Mutiny On The Bounty","Author":"Charles Bernard Nordhoff","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"imran.ahmed@cruise.me","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-20T21:41:36.1277059Z"},{"Id":"4a6d4beb-3d2f-4e64-b569-b1bcc9ff8e23","Slug":"tales-of-the-south-pacific-by-james-a-michener","Title":"Tales of the South Pacific","Author":"James A.

It is now home to some excellent art galleries and museums which\r\nilluminate further the city’s past along with providing educational and\r\naesthetic edification.&nbsp; The Karama and\r\nSatwar districts are also fascinating places to indulge in a stroll and a\r\nwander, as you wonder at this multifaceted city which has so much more to offer\r\nthe traveler than it would seem at first glance.&nbsp; It would be a mistake, of course, not to take\r\nadvantage of Dubai’s seeming limitless enthusiasm for shopping, fine dining,\r\nand luxurious living and there are more than enough opportunities in the city\r\nfor you to do so.&nbsp; Elsewhere in the\r\nEmirates take a trip to Abu Dhabi, which has much more to say for itself other\r\nthan simply being known as the ‘richest city in the world’.&nbsp; The city is home to the world’s third largest\r\nmosque, the Grand Mosque as it is known colloquially, or Sheikh Zayed Bin\r\nSultan al Nahyan Mosque is a stunning display of Islamic architecture, entirely\r\ndecorated in white and gold it is an aesthetic feast for the eyes, as well as\r\nvisually arresting in its vastness (it&nbsp;\r\ncan hold up to 41,000 people).&nbsp;\r\nFor further exploration of the city and country’s cultural history and\r\nsignificance head to the Cultural Foundation, home to the National Archives,\r\nNational Library, and the Institute of Culture and Art it is sure to shed some\r\nlight on this fascinating country.&nbsp; For a\r\nbreath of fresh air and a stunning view of Abu Dhabi’s skyline, do as the\r\nlocals do and head to the Corniche a sandy promenade which spans the length of\r\nAbu Dhabi’s coast.&nbsp; A treat at any time\r\nof the time it is especially beautiful at dusk when you will be joined in your\r\nwander by locals and be further treated to the gentle illumination of the\r\ncity’s skyline as twilight falls over the United Arab Emirates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oman has yet to erect the kind of\r\nbombastic, shopping-mad façade that has befallen the cities of Dubai and Abu\r\nDhabi, but there is nevertheless still a feeling of a city on the brink of\r\ngreatness in Muscat, the country’s capital which is rapidly turning into a\r\nvibrant and energetic 21<sup>st</sup> century metropolis.&nbsp; It is also, however, full of historical\r\nriches, antique, architectural beauties, religious buildings of note, and\r\nexcellently educational and elucidating museums.&nbsp; &nbsp;The\r\nGrand Mosque of Muscat is a relative newcomer, especially in this part of the\r\nworld, having been built in the early 1990s, it is, however, no less stunning\r\nfor this fact.&nbsp; A sumptuous visual\r\ndisplay of religious reverence, the mosque also houses the second largest\r\nPersian rug in the world and a majestic Swarovski crystal chandelier.&nbsp; A visit to Muscat is also the perfect excuse\r\nto get to know more about the country’s most loved sporting event; camel\r\nracing.&nbsp; Horse racing is almost as\r\npopular, but for a truly unique experience it’s got to be camel racing. Oman is\r\nalso one of the greenest cities in the Middle East, and there is no better\r\nplace to realize this than at the Qurum National Park which is a mixture of\r\nlushly landscape green areas combined with stunning architecture.&nbsp; Away from Muscat a pilgrimage to the\r\nFrankincense Trail in Salalah is a must; an ancient significant trading post,\r\nSalalah used to the capital city and seat of previous sultans until the current\r\nsultan moved to Muscat.&nbsp; You can visit\r\nthe former palace which dates back to the 19<sup>th</sup> century and now\r\nserves as the summer house for Sultan Qaboos.&nbsp;\r\nFull of history, cultural significance and artifacts this is wonderfully\r\nbeguiling building in which to learn more about Oman’s history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jordan is a world renowned site of\r\ncultural, historical and religious significance, which coupled with a warm and\r\nfriendly welcome from locals and the teeming and tremendously diverse capital\r\nof Amman makes it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Middle\r\nEast.&nbsp; Part of the reason for this, of\r\ncourse, is the ancient, lost city of Petra.&nbsp;\r\nFor a certain generation of filmgoers the lost city will be remembered\r\nin perpetuity for its role in <i>Indiana\r\nJones and the Last Crusade</i>, but for many more others it is a simply\r\nspellbinding ‘city’ hewn out of stone and dating as far back as the 6<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury B.C. With such a long and illustrious history as this, it is no wonder\r\nthat it is also thought to be the site of the oldest Christian church in the\r\nworld.&nbsp; Often viewed at dawn to avoid the\r\nheat of the day, Petra is a place one never forgets, a truly magical and\r\nmystical city that completely lives up to the hype and your own\r\nexpectations.&nbsp; This is one absolute\r\nmust-see in Jordan.&nbsp; But, there is more\r\nto this country than lost, ancient cities, and you would be remiss to miss out\r\non all it has to offer.&nbsp; As one of the\r\nsafer countries to visit in this part of the world (it is bordered by Iraq, Syria,\r\nIsrael and Saudi Arabia) it is worth spending more time here than it takes just\r\nto experience Petra.&nbsp; One such experience\r\nnot to be missed is a trip into the desert to Wadi Rum, home of the Bedouins.&nbsp; With awe inspiring peaks and valleys made\r\nentirely of sand, vast expanses of empty, desolate space, the welcoming\r\nhospitality of the Bedouins and the biggest, most star filled skies you are\r\never likely to see at night, Wadi Rum is spellbinding, beguiling, and simply\r\nunforgettable.&nbsp; In the resort town of\r\nAqaba enjoy the beaches, blue water and year-round balmy weather.&nbsp; Sat on the gulf that leads to the Red Sea,\r\nAqaba is extremely popular with Jordanian vacationers, and rightly so; the\r\ndiving and snorkeling opportunities are stupendous and the laid-back, relaxed,\r\nbeachside atmosphere is simply divine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bahrain’s capital of Manama there is\r\nmore ancient history and antique culture on display, yet it is all surrounded\r\nby a truly modern, cosmopolitan, 21<sup>st</sup> century city.&nbsp; Take a trip to the National Museum where you\r\ncan learn all about the ancient burial mounds, forts and buildings which dot\r\nthe country before heading out to visit such sites of interest.&nbsp; The Bahrain Fort, which is over 3000 years\r\nold, is a great place to start such an exploration of the country.&nbsp; Continue on your journey by paying a visit to\r\nBeit Sheikh Isa bin Ali, the 19<sup>th</sup> century residence of Muharraq and\r\nfollow this with a trip to the burial grounds at Sar to get a full picture of\r\nthe ancient life of Bahrain.&nbsp; And for\r\nthose who like their sightseeing with a side order of shopping, Bahrain will\r\nnot disappoint.&nbsp; In Qatar, the capital\r\ncity of Doha is another shining example of modern day Middle East, with skyscrapers,\r\nshopping emporia, first class restaurants and luxury hotels aplenty, this city\r\nhas almost certainly been taking a leaf out of Dubai’s book recently.&nbsp; The past is still visible here, however, and\r\nput on display in the city’s largest souq; Souq Waqif with its labyrinthine\r\npassages where every variety of spice imaginable and much, much more is\r\navailable for your delectation.&nbsp; For\r\ntrips out of the city and into the vast desert a day spent in the singing sand\r\ndunes cannot be beaten.&nbsp; This eerie and\r\nyet stunning and awe inspiring area is renowned for the ‘singing’ hum which is\r\nproduced when low humidity combines with high winds.&nbsp; Elsewhere, Al-khor is a delightful fishing\r\nvillage which displays a completely different side to Qatar than cosmopolitan\r\nDoha; take a day here to soak up the atmosphere and appreciate the wide variety\r\nof people and lifestyles which populate this desert nation.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Ashdod in Israel you will be able to\r\nvisit Jerusalem, one of the most, if not the most religiously significant city\r\nin the world for Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike.&nbsp; A city built on spirituality and with a\r\nhistory as long as history itself, there are destinations of historic, cultural\r\nand religious significance around almost every corner in Jerusalem, and yet it\r\nis also a modern 21<sup>st</sup> century city.&nbsp;\r\nTravelers and pilgrims make the trip to Jerusalem in their droves every\r\nyear, intent on visiting one of the most holy places on earth, as well as the\r\nunique cultural matrix that has occurred over the centuries by forming a\r\ngenuine cultural meeting point between Europe, Asia and Africa as well as the\r\nthree main monotheistic religions.&nbsp; This\r\nis a city which awes and inspires in equal measure from the ancient\r\narchitecture which is still standing after centuries of war, wear and tear, and\r\nthe ravages of time to the buzz of the bazaars.&nbsp;\r\nWatch in wonder at the Wailing Wall, be dazzled by the iconic golden\r\ntopped Dome of the Rock, and walk the ancient Via Dolorosa which is considered\r\nto be the last path Jesus walked down.&nbsp;\r\nFor a comprehensive overview and educational edification head to the\r\nIsrael Museum which charts the city and country’s fascinating history, before\r\nheading out into the streets to experience the dizzying, electrifying and\r\nenthralling present.&nbsp; Away from Jerusalem,\r\ntake the time to catch your breath at one of Israel’s premier resorts in Eilat,\r\nwhich with its stunning seas, wide beautiful beaches and perfect weather has\r\ncreated quite a profile as a beach resort.&nbsp;\r\nRelax at Coral Beach before setting off on a desert adventure in the\r\nNegev, where you can hike, trek, take a 4x4 ride or even a camel through some\r\nof Israel’s most spectacular scenery.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"967c4c7c-4512-4610-a341-b35f7ea30177","Slug":"a-thousand-splendid-suns-by-khaled-hosseini","Title":"A Thousand Splendid Suns","Author":"Khaled Hosseini","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"imran.ahmed@cruise.me","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-20T21:13:12.8179394Z"},{"Id":"db71cd6c-7135-41d4-a93b-c1f6dd352988","Slug":"a-woman-in-jerusalem-by-a-b-yehoushua","Title":"A Woman in Jerusalem","Author":"A.B.

</i>The area is a social, cultural,\r\nhistorical and political melting pot; one which has had to deal with war,\r\nrevolution and natural disaster and yet maintains optimism and a sense of\r\ndelight in the future which is both admirable and delightfully irresistible.&nbsp; Nowhere is this best witnessed than in\r\nVietnam, a veritable cauldron of cultural influences which will leave you as\r\nsatisfied and sated as a bowl of the country’s famous culinary dish of Pho!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where better to start than in the ancient\r\ncity of Ho Chi Minh City, the country’s largest city (although not the\r\ncapital), formerly (and still by many locals) known as Saigon, this a city with\r\nfast paced change on the brain, and its seemingly limitless energy may well\r\nleave you feeling physically exhausted, albeit very satisfyingly so.&nbsp; With a strong French influence still in\r\nevidence, a remnant of the country’s colonial past, you can catch your breath\r\nat one of the city’s fine cafes, sip on a delicious cup of coffee and even\r\nindulge in some pastry or baguettes worthy of even Paris’s finest\r\npatisseries.&nbsp; The frenetic energy of this\r\ncity combines with cultural hangovers of France’s colonial rule in the most\r\nsynergistic manner, as you move from museums sat on wide boulevards to tiny\r\nalleyways leading to ancient pagodas, and sample the epicurean version of such\r\nseamless cultural integration in the form of the famous Banh Mi baguette.&nbsp; There are, of course, much more recent\r\nhistorical hangovers left from the US war, but the best place to go to get an\r\nidea of what remains are the excellent History Museum and War Remnants Museum,\r\nbefore heading back out into the winding streets, the hustle of the markets\r\nsuch as Ben Thanh, or to the Giac Vien Pagoda where you can witness the lived\r\nhistory for yourself, and the way in which it has been transformed into a\r\nbubbling, bustling, beautiful present.&nbsp; Like\r\nthe rest of the country, Ho Chi Minh City is a place of wide variety, constant\r\nchange and high energy levels and is certainly not for the weak of heart, but\r\nfor those in search of adventure it will do nothing but reward you.&nbsp; Hanoi, the nation’s capital and home to 6.5 million\r\ninhabits is as frenetic and energetic as its sister city Ho Chi Minh City,\r\nalbeit with more obvious areas for rest and respite such as the charmingly\r\ntranquil Hoan Kiem Lake, with resident turtles, and the famous, ancient\r\nbuilding of Tháp Rùa which appears to magically float at the center of the\r\nlake.&nbsp; There are wide, beautiful\r\nboulevards and buildings which betray France’s past attempts at colonialism, as\r\nwell as communist-era concrete behemoths, but both combine with Hanoi’s more\r\nancient, authentically Asian heart and fast paced move towards the future to create\r\na completely unique modern metropolis at the center of one of Asia’s most\r\nfascinating countries.&nbsp; The History\r\nMuseum and Army Museum are two educational musts, as are Ho Chi Minh’s\r\nmausoleum and House to learn more about Vietnam’s recent past.&nbsp; To personally witness the architectural\r\nlegacy of Vietnam’s more ancient past, wandering the streets of the Old Quarter\r\nis a charming and charismatic way in which to do so.&nbsp; From Hanoi take the time to take a trip to\r\none of Asia’s most iconic, inspiring and stunningly beautiful sites of Halong\r\nBay.&nbsp; A UNESCO World Heritage Site whose\r\nmisty, mysterious and mystical charm will mystify and enchant you in equal\r\nmeasure, the Bay is best viewed at dawn from the deck of a ship whilst\r\ncontemplating myth, legends and the magical beauty of such an extraordinary\r\nplace.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cambodia is a stunning and exciting place\r\nto unwind after the frantic pace of sightseeing in Vietnam, with beautiful\r\nsandy beaches, crystal waters, and tropical jungles, this is where all your\r\ndreams of a Southeast Asian beachside retreat will come true.&nbsp; In Sihanoukville relax on pristine,\r\nnear-deserted beaches such as Otres, which will certainly come through on the\r\npromise to be far from the maddening crowds, explore the local markets, and\r\nlearn to cook up a storm Cambodian style.&nbsp;\r\nThis is a part of Cambodia which has yet to be fully colonized by the\r\nvacationer and tourist trail, making it a really unique place to visit in Asia\r\nat this point in time.&nbsp; With natural\r\nbeauty as far as the eye can see, friendly locals, a warm welcome, not to\r\nmention a perfect climate and delicious local cuisine, this is the perfect\r\nplace to chill out, relax and get to know Southeast Asia in a calming and\r\ncharming environment.&nbsp; This is also the\r\nideal time to take another look at Myanmar, formerly known as Burma as it\r\nbegins to develop its tourism infrastructure and to welcome foreign travelers\r\nand Western visitors once again.&nbsp; With a\r\nrich and fascinating, if highly troubled and problematic past Myanmar has been\r\nsomething of a controversial state all of which serves to make it a remarkable\r\ncountry to spend time in.&nbsp; Head to the\r\ncity of Yangon, nee Rangoon, which has been enchanting visitors and locals\r\nalike with its religious history and significance where your first stop must be\r\nat Shwedagon Paya.&nbsp; Built on the land\r\nwhere as legend has it five lotus flowers once bloomed, symbolizing the five\r\nBuddha, these visually arresting pagoda are more than just aesthetically and\r\narchitecturally beautiful; they positively reverberate with spirituality,\r\nreligious and historical significance, and tranquil meditation.&nbsp; Another spot perfect for meditation in the\r\nmiddle of the city, only this time of the horticultural variety is the Mahabandoola\r\nGarden, where hundreds of roses bloom, allowing you to breathe in the warm and\r\nfragrant air whilst contemplating the impressive vista of Yangon’s downtown\r\narea.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thailand is known to many different people\r\nas many different things; representing the nadir of backpacker hedonism, as\r\nwell as tranquil beach sanctuaries, tropical forests full of fascinating\r\nwildlife, or the manic hustle and bustle of Bangkok, there is a Thailand for\r\neverybody, it is simply up to you which one you choose to sample.&nbsp; The ‘backpacker heaven’ image that Bangkok\r\nhas slowly cultivated over the past couple of decade occludes the actual visual\r\nbeauty of the city, fascinating history on display, and warm welcome of the\r\nlocals to travelers of all&nbsp; types.&nbsp; Wat Kalayanamit is an absolute must, being\r\none of Thailand’s finest temples with the biggest sitting Buddha in the country\r\non display, it is also best accessed via water taxi which makes for a pleasant,\r\nalternative view of the city and its splendors.&nbsp;\r\nNo one leaves Bangkok without a trip to the Grand Palace, or at least\r\nthey shouldn’t if they want the full city experience.&nbsp; This is one of the most beautiful and\r\ninspiring historical and architectural sites in Southeast Asia, with elaborately\r\ncarved designs and decorations from the 18<sup>th</sup> century when the palace\r\nwas constructed.&nbsp; Take the time out to\r\nexplore the city’s famous floating markets at Damoen Sadoak, then take a rest in\r\nLumphini Park, or somewhere with a little more urban cool, such as the\r\nfantastic roof top bar at Vertigo where sunset and a drink go hand in hand\r\nwhilst drinking in the panoramic view of the city.&nbsp; Away from Bangkok, Phuket is probably one of\r\nThailand’s most popular and famous haunts.&nbsp;\r\nThe country’s largest island and almost unimaginably beautiful, it is\r\nvisited by hordes of travelers and tourists every year, and hosts some of the\r\ncountry’s, if not the world’s most popular beaches.&nbsp; Diving, snorkeling and sunbathing are the\r\nmain pursuits in Phuket, as well as it’s infamous party scene, renowned for\r\nbeach bars and all-night nightclubs, this is certainly somewhere, much like the\r\nrest of Southeast Asia which advocates letting go and letting your hair\r\ndown. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"9866ef9e-201e-4cd6-b5b4-5f6af01c6318","Slug":"a-hundred-years-of-happiness-by-nicole-a-seitz","Title":"A Hundred Years of Happiness","Author":"Nicole A.

By far the best place to view the wonderful wildlife that calls\r\nCosta Rica home is Parque Nacional Corcovado, where you will be in with a\r\nchance of spotting tapirs, giant anteaters, harpy eagles and if you’re\r\nincredibly lucky, the much-hunted and tragically endangered Central American\r\njaguar.&nbsp; For a little wild underwater adventuring\r\nhead to Playa Conchal, widely considered and voted the most beautiful beach in\r\nCosta Rica, which really is saying something in this corner of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Panama’s global profile as a tourism\r\ndestination is on the rise but although it would be remiss not to go before it\r\nchanges too much, the beauty of the country, and warm welcome of the locals are\r\nsure to keep this a destination worth visiting at any time, regardless of any\r\nover-crowding which may be in its future.&nbsp;\r\nIn the Caribbean Sea there are seemingly endless strings and ranges of\r\npristine, unspoiled archipelagoes, providing seclusion and privacy in a truly\r\nparadisiacal setting.&nbsp; The Islands of\r\nBocas del Toro are by far the most popular in Panama and make up the heart of\r\nthe country’s tourism industry.&nbsp; They are\r\nnone too spoiled by development, however, and provide a great introduction to\r\nthe area as well as a truly relaxing, laid-back atmosphere which is obviously\r\ngreatly influenced by its Caribbean setting.&nbsp;\r\nColorful wooden houses rub alongside one another in town of Bocas del\r\nToro on Isla Colon, where wandering aimlessly is a sport in and of itself, with\r\nplenty to look at and enjoy, safe in the knowledge that the beach is always\r\nbeckoning.&nbsp; For water babies the\r\nturquoise waters are a good luck charm for snorkelers and divers especially at\r\nStarfish Beach, which as you may have surmised is a great place to spot starfish.&nbsp; Bocas is a place to relax, unwind, and soak\r\nup the Caribbean vibe.&nbsp; It’s a place\r\nwhere its best to always have a cocktail in hand, a bikini or board shorts on,\r\nand an eye on the beach, all of which begs the questions; what’s not to love\r\nand why ever would you leave? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nicaragua is the least developed for\r\ntourism, and certainly the least visited of this charming trio of Central\r\nAmerican countries, but leave it off your must-see list at your peril.&nbsp; Known as the ‘Land of Lakes and Volcanoes’ a\r\ntrip to the smoking Volcán Concepción is a must, and if you’re an exercise\r\njunkie or adrenaline&nbsp; loving adventurer\r\nso too is the Maribios Volcanic Chain where you’ll come across dozens of crater\r\nlazes, hot springs and a challenging climb.&nbsp;\r\nAway from this awe inspiring natural beauty head towards the colonial\r\ncity of Granada, founded in 1524 making it the oldest city in the New\r\nWorld.&nbsp; Sat on the shores of the\r\nmagnificent Lago de Nicaragua, Granada has a majestic charm and beauty of its\r\nown, built as it was as a showpiece for the Spanish empire.&nbsp; This grand old city has had its problems, including\r\npiratical ransacking in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and civil war with Nicaragua’s\r\nalternative city of Leon in the 1850s, but it has been restored to a fine\r\nsemblance of its former glory with a keen eye.&nbsp;\r\nThe liberal yin to Granada’s conservative yang, Leon is the cultural\r\ncapital of the country if not the actual capital.&nbsp; Teeming with art, museums and universities,\r\nLeon and its citizens prides itself on its liberal outlook, bohemian nature,\r\nand cultural eclecticism.&nbsp; Having once\r\nsat on the sloping sides of Volcan Momotombo the city was razed to the ground\r\nby an eruption in 1610, and now sits in its current location. It is also home\r\nto Central America’s largest Cathedral as well as many other historically\r\nsignificant buildings and architectural gems.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"9d52e8ca-ac9e-40a4-bfdd-8463c22e8145","Slug":"assault-on-paradise-by-tatiana-lobo","Title":"Assault on

do believe the hype.&nbsp; These islands, as so many visitors are keen\r\nto tell friends and family upon return to ‘real life’, are paradise on\r\nearth.&nbsp; There is the ideal, almost\r\nperfect climate, the truly relaxed attitude to life, the expanses of pristine\r\nsandy beaches and the opportunity to explore the warm, crystalline waters\r\nsurrounding the islands; water which is known as the clearest in the world with\r\na visibility of over 200 feet.&nbsp; It is no\r\nsurprise then, that with such crystal clear waters, snorkelling and scuba\r\ndiving are immensely popular, especially when it comes to exploring the\r\nunderwater playground that is the world’s third largest barrier reef.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the sixteen main islands in the archipelago, New\r\nProvidence Island home to capital city Nassau is certainly one of the most\r\nvisited.&nbsp; Despite its compact size, there\r\nis a cosmopolitan feel to the city, but with the ever present laid-back\r\nCaribbean slant that has people coming back to the area time after time.&nbsp; From here you can set off on a dolphin encounter\r\nadventure, an opportunity many visitors take up, sitting as it does at the top\r\nof so many people’s bucket lists.&nbsp; Blue\r\nLagoon Island is one of the most popular destinations for a chance to encounter\r\ndolphins and sits just off the coast of Salt Cay, in a very manageable position\r\nfor a day trip from Nassau.&nbsp; Here,\r\nthousands of people’s dreams have come true as they’ve succumbed to the\r\ndelight, and playful nature of the dolphins who call this area home.&nbsp; There are hundreds of thousands of\r\nopportunities to explore and encounter the natural wonders of the Bahamas at\r\npretty much every corner, and at every turn.&nbsp;\r\nThe history of the islands is also on display however, and it is a rich\r\nand exciting history indeed, one which is sure to enchant and educate.&nbsp; One of the best spots to begin an educative\r\nexploration of the area is at Fort Charlotte in Nassau, where the pirates who\r\npopulated, and often perpetrated crimes in the area where held in dungeons,\r\nwhilst their captors roamed the underground tunnels that you too can wander\r\ndown.&nbsp; Later, in downtown Nassau, get the\r\nPirate’s side of the story at the Pirates of Nassau Museum, a brilliantly\r\ninteractive museum which outlines the life of a pirate, and even has a replica\r\nof the infamous pirate ship ‘Revenge’.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Away from Nassau and its streets lined with duty free shopping\r\nopportunities, are the pure shores and azure waters of hundreds of other\r\nislands just waiting for you to explore them, and in turn be enchanted by\r\nthem.&nbsp; Grand Bahama, as the name\r\nsuggests, is a good place to start such an exploration, and as with Nassau on\r\nNew Providence, is one of the busier, and more inhabited islands in the\r\nBahamas.&nbsp; There’s a special feel to Grand\r\nBahama, however, what with the large resorts which can be found there, combined\r\nwith unspoilt beaches, and charming small fishing towns. &nbsp;The two main cities of Freeport and Lacaya\r\nare surely not to be missed, but neither are the smaller towns of West End,\r\nEight Mile Rock, High Rock or McLean's Town where the streets are lined with\r\nthe sunny brightly painted wooden houses that the Caribbean is famed for.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it’s fishing you’re after, then there is no finer spot\r\nthan that of the Bimini islands, a sentiment agreed with by none other than\r\nErnest Hemingway who wrote both <i>Islands\r\nin the Stream</i> and <i>To Have and Have\r\nNot</i> here, both of which serve as literary odes to the islands and the sport\r\nof big game fishing.&nbsp; The chance of\r\ncatching a marlin, wahoo, or sailfish are very high in the waters off the\r\nBimini islands, and if the perfect catch of the day is your idea of a perfect\r\nday then these are the islands, and this is the sport for you.&nbsp; The area is a beacon for divers of all\r\nability as well, drawn to the lost city of Atlantis which lies just off the\r\nshore of the Biminis, beginners and experienced divers alike often take this\r\nopportunity to explore one of the world’s most beguiling underwater wonders.&nbsp; San Salvador and Rum Cay are also two islands\r\neagerly sought out by those seeking rest and relaxation, with perhaps the added\r\nthrill of a dive or snorkel or two in some of the world’s clearest waters.&nbsp; San Salvador has retained much of its\r\nhistory, and not only at the island’s fine museum, but also in the atmosphere,\r\npace of life, and attitude of the island.&nbsp;\r\nMany of the historical plantations still exist, which you are able to\r\nexplore and where you can learn about the often troubled past of such houses,\r\nalbeit in deceptively idyllic surroundings.&nbsp;\r\nThere is the picturesque lighthouse to climb to the top of, from where\r\nyou are treated to miles of unspoilt views, and the archaeological site of the\r\nLucayan Indians is also a fascinating and worthwhile visit.&nbsp; There is no denying, however, that the\r\nmajority of visitors to the paradisiacal islands of the Bahamas are in large\r\npart there to soak up the sun, stretch out on the pristine white sand, splash\r\naround in the crystalline surf and sip on a sublimely refreshing cocktail and\r\nif is what you’re here for, then you’re sure to find it in spades.&nbsp;</p><p></p>\r\n","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"1c9fa026-a157-4ec2-af59-de0d4d315a7f","Slug":"an-embarrassment-of-mangoes-by-ann-vanderhoof","Title":"An Embarrassment of Mangoes","Author":"Ann Vanderhoof","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:35:03.1305805Z"},{"Id":"2da5efda-f4da-434b-b6ed-b6ece44df2a2","Slug":"any-human-heart-by-william-boyd","Title":"Any Human Heart","Author":"William Boyd","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:35:06.4857724Z"},{"Id":"21b5d76d-fba8-49b5-bc42-f14d61ae0c71","Slug":"bahamarama-by-bob-morris","Title":"Bahamarama","Author":"Bob Morris","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:35:10.2719889Z"},{"Id":"dfa4e088-748f-4590-a354-c8f40df06847","Slug":"cereus-blooms-at-night-by-shani-mootoo","Title":"Cereus Blooms at Night","Author":"Shani Mootoo","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:35:13.001145Z"},{"Id":"6e33b006-ae6c-4d46-876e-37024e4cdebf","Slug":"islands-in-the-stream-by-ernest-hemingway","Title":"Islands in the Stream","Author":"Ernest Hemingway","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:35:15.483287Z"},{"Id":"406a9fc4-00b7-4bca-87dd-b269b0ce422e","Slug":"pirates-by-celia-rees","Title":"Pirates!","Author":"Celia Rees","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:35:17.9164262Z"},{"Id":"e3b9afa6-8dfb-487a-9a85-dd42c67e0e3f","Slug":"the-brief-wondrous-life-of-oscar-wao-by-junot-diaz","Title":"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao","Author":"Junot Diaz","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:35:20.5735782Z"},{"Id":"5689647b-9741-4ea9-a020-65a612073f74","Slug":"the-rum-diary-by-hunter-s-thompson","Title":"The Rum Diary","Author":"Hunter S.

There’s a Mexico for everyone on offer on the\r\ncountry’s stunning West Coast, as you cruise along the country’s party towns of\r\nAcapulco, tourist haven and celebrity favourite Cabo San Lucas, local’s\r\nfavourite Mazatlan, colonial city on the sea Puerto Vallarta, and hidden gems\r\nsuch as Puerto Escondido.&nbsp; Mexico is a\r\ncountry to indulge and relax in, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t enough on\r\noffer to keep even the most dedicated thrill junkie happy, or historical buff\r\nand culture vulture in raptures.&nbsp; There’s\r\nmore to life than the sun, sea, and margaritas that Mexico has largely sold\r\nitself on to the vast number of tourists who visit every year, and best of all is\r\nthat all it has to offer is set out under the blistering sun.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the tip of the Baja Peninsula, and serving as the sandy\r\nand sunny playground of California’s rich and famous, is Los Cabos which\r\ncomprises of Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. &nbsp;Cabo San Lucas is probably the better known of\r\nthe two, with its pristine beaches, and large resort lined beachfront, but San\r\nJose del Cabo deserves to be explored as well.&nbsp;\r\nA beautiful old Spanish colonial town, San Jose del Cabo is a cobbled\r\nlined haven of grand old architecture and dazzlingly enjoyable and eclectic\r\nshops and restaurants.&nbsp; The two towns\r\nwhich make up Los Cabos are connected by a beautiful beach, from which you can\r\nenjoy parasailing, banana boating, and further off shore some of the best scuba\r\nand snorkelling opportunities in Mexico.&nbsp;\r\nAlternatively you can travel to where the Mexicans holiday in Mazatlan,\r\na vibrant and full to bursting seaside town on the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp; Mazatlan is a favourite with Mexicans from\r\nall over the country, so you know it must be good.&nbsp; With a fine historic centre including some\r\ngorgeous old architecture, appealing shops and boutiques, great bars and\r\nrestaurants, as well as a fantastic beach promenade which has an almost European\r\natmosphere, and where those with penchant for evening strolls head come\r\nsundown, there’s something to charm everyone, including even the most\r\ndiscerning of travellers in Mazatlan.&nbsp;\r\nThere’s horseback riding on the beach, and just 45 miles to the south a\r\ntruly invigorating and educational tree canopy tour to partake in. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manzanillo has been a popular destination with tourists and\r\ntravellers for a while now, and especially with those who are keen scuba\r\ndivers.&nbsp; With some of the best spots to\r\ndive in not too far off shore from this port city, this fact is fairly\r\nunsurprising.&nbsp; If you’re looking for\r\nsomething a little more unspoilt, however, Bahia de Navidad just north of the\r\ncity should be your next port of call.&nbsp; A\r\ncrescent shaped bay of golden sandy beaches, Bahia de Navidad has the unique ability\r\nto drive all your troubles away.&nbsp; Sit\r\nback on a sun lounger, sip on a margarita, indulge in a fish taco and feel any\r\nresidue stress drain away.&nbsp; At the south\r\nend of the Bahia de Navidad bay is the small fishing town of Barra de Navidad,\r\na pleasant little place with plenty of character and live music on the\r\nbeach.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Pacific Coast of the state of Oaxaca, well known as\r\none of Mexico’s most intriguing and seductive areas, lies the ‘hidden port’ or\r\nPuerto Escondido.&nbsp; The town itself is set\r\nin a tranquil and peaceful bay, which is in fact the reason why it was founded\r\nhere, as the coffee planters and growers who worked the land at the foot of the\r\nlocal mountain range decided it was the perfect spot for shipping all that\r\nlocally grown coffee out of the area.&nbsp;\r\nBut Puerto Escondido is also very well known to surfers as the home of\r\nthe Mexican Pipeline, possibly Mexico’s most famous break.&nbsp; The combination of the laid back surfing way\r\nof life and the town’s adherence to its more humble beginnings as a traditional\r\nfishing town means that Puerto Escondido is simply one of the most charming\r\nbeachside towns in Mexico.&nbsp; Completely mesmerising\r\nin its simplicity and natural beauty, Puerto Escondido is the home to a vast\r\narray of natural wildlife, including birdlife, whales and sea turtles; there is\r\nsomething to see at every turn.&nbsp; As with\r\nmuch of the Mexican coast, great scuba diving and snorkelling opportunities are\r\nonly a boat ride away, but in Puerto Escondido you can also explore the coastal\r\nlagoons of Manialtepec and Chacahua.&nbsp;\r\nThis is a tranquil and charmingly laid back and relaxed town that is\r\nsimply not to be missed. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Puerto Vallarta and Acapulco may be two of Mexico’s best\r\nknown and most visited west coast beach side towns, but that doesn’t make them\r\nany less appealing.&nbsp; Puerto Vallarta, far\r\nfrom being ruined by the hordes of tourists who visit every year, has held up\r\nits appealing façade with the glamour and grace of the finest Hollywood\r\nstar.&nbsp; The city is nestled into the lush\r\ngreenery of the surrounding mountains and forests, whilst showing off its\r\nglitzier side to the greedy Pacific Ocean.&nbsp;\r\nWhere the holidaying hordes frolic is down on the sand, in the shadow of\r\nthe city’s charming colonial architecture, and in the basking beauty of the sun\r\nand the gentle surf of the Pacific.&nbsp;\r\nThere’s an international atmosphere to Puerto Vallarta which isn’t just\r\nbound to the thousands of foreign visitors who flock here every year.&nbsp; The traditional cobblestone streets are lined\r\nwith world renowned restaurants, swanky boutiques, and there’s a great bar and\r\ncafé culture to entertain in the sultry evenings and warm nights, when only a\r\nfrosty Michelada, or chilled tequila will do.&nbsp;\r\nAcapulco, of course, is most famous for being the site of many a young\r\nAmerican’s spring break antics – not that they’ll remember any of it if you\r\nhappen to ask about the town -&nbsp; but\r\nbehind its heavy drinking and hearty partying reputation is a friendly city set\r\nin one of Mexico’s most beautiful and sheltered bays.&nbsp; Which is why, of course all the visitors came\r\nin the first place.&nbsp; There are plenty of\r\nvast resorts on the beach front but only slightly further afield are protected\r\ncoves, and of course be sure not to miss the legendary cliff-divers, who jump\r\ninto the roaring surf from the top of the cliffs overlooking the sea on the\r\nnorth side of town as a regular occurrence.&nbsp;\r\nOnly thrill-seekers need apply.</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"7b7c0003-9e66-4980-9363-e1412dcf0772","Slug":"frida-the-biography-of-frida-kahlo-by-hayden-herrera","Title":"Frida: The Biography of Frida Kahlo","Author":"Hayden Herrera","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:44:05.2615886Z"},{"Id":"e269f3ac-c8fc-4830-b7ff-a86be052f12f","Slug":"mornings-in-mexico-by-d-h-lawrence","Title":"Mornings in Mexico","Author":"D.H.

Echoing with wilderness,\r\nand sheer, breath taking space, Alaska’s landscape is all about scope, scenery,\r\nand the call of the wild.&nbsp; The cities of\r\nAnchorage, State capital Juneau and Sitka provide some cosmopolitan respite,\r\nbut it’s really all about America’s natural beauty when you’re this far\r\nnorth.&nbsp; One of the US’s least populated\r\nstates, finding a quiet spot to catch your breath shouldn’t prove a problem in\r\nAlaska, although you might just find yourself having your breath taken away\r\nagain by the sight of one of the area’s glaciers, as you cruise through Glacier\r\nBay, Hubbard Glacier, or Tracy’s Arm Fjord.&nbsp;\r\nWatch as the landscape literally changes before your eyes as ice calving\r\nis a common, albeit phenomenal sight to witness from the safety of the\r\nboat.&nbsp; Be sure to also keep your eyes\r\npeeled for the vast numbers and variety of wild animals that call Alaska\r\nhome.&nbsp; Moose, bald eagles, deer, and\r\nwhales are all native to the area and are often visible to visitors as the\r\nships cruise through Tracy’s Arm Fjord.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere in the state and a particular favorite with both\r\nnature lovers and thrill seekers alike is the possibility of dog sledding in\r\nHaines and a sighting of the famous bears of Kodiak Island.&nbsp; The likelihood of seeing one (or more) of the\r\nKodiak bears is greatly increased during the summer months of June-August when\r\nthey can be seen fishing for salmon.&nbsp;\r\nFishing is one of the area’s biggest industries, but it is also one of\r\nthe most popular past times in Alaska, for both visitors and Alaskans.&nbsp; Whether you’re a seasoned fisherman or woman,\r\na fan of fly-, freshwater, or saltwater fishing, there’s a catch of the day for\r\nevery taste and occasion just waiting to be caught in Alaska.&nbsp; With Ketchikan known as the ‘salmon fishing\r\ncapital of the world’ and over 3,000 rivers and around 3 million lakes in\r\nAlaska, fishing is much more than just a vital industry; it’s a way of\r\nlife.&nbsp; Ketchikan is also home to the\r\nTotem Bright State Park, where it is possible to learn more about the Native\r\nway of life in Alaska, prior to and during the settlement of the land by the\r\nUnited States.&nbsp; Both at Totem Bright, and\r\nat other points in the state, villages once lost to the resettlement of Native\r\nAmericans elsewhere have been restored with care, so that the totem poles on\r\ndisplay can both inspire and educate.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those in the mood for more culture - and with so much to\r\nlearn to learn about this fascinating and oft-overlooked area, who wouldn’t be?\r\n–then the city of Sitka is not to be missed.&nbsp;\r\nFounded by Russia in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, it was once the\r\nprimary port, and most important city on the West coast of North America,\r\nbefore the much larger and better known cities of Seattle and San Francisco\r\ncame to prominence.&nbsp; Learn all about the\r\narea’s Russian past at the Russian Bishop’s House, now an informative museum,\r\nthen head to the National Historical Park where the land’s past prior to both\r\nthe settlement of the Russians and Americans is explored.&nbsp; A visit to this part of the world would not\r\nbe complete without a trip up the Inside Passage, surely one of the natural\r\nwonders of the world which also spreads into British Columbia in Canada.&nbsp; Travel in this distinctive and awe inspiring\r\narea will take you to some of the most remote parts of North America, allowing\r\nvisitors to revel in views and vistas most people will never get the chance to\r\nsee or share in.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you travel through the Inside Passage, be sure not to\r\nmiss some of the most beautiful sights Canada’s west coast has to offer.&nbsp; British Columbia promises action, adventure,\r\ndiversity and stunning natural beauty from the cosmopolitan city centre of\r\nVancouver to the Queen Charlotte Islands, also known as Haida Gwaii, this\r\nnaturally gifted province of Canada has something for everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;Further\r\nnorth, there is Whitehorse in Yukon Territory which forms part of the Alaska\r\nMarine Highway and helps to provide a little urban renewal for all those\r\ntravellers who might be overwhelmed by the sheer natural beauty and remoteness\r\nof the area.&nbsp; With plenty of gift shops\r\nand a smattering of local restaurants, visitors can take in the sights, sounds\r\nand smells of Whitehorse with time left over to spend at the area’s famous hot\r\nsprings.&nbsp; With the history of the city\r\nbeing steeped in gold prospecting, there’s also plenty to learn about the area\r\nhere; a good place to start is at the SS Klondike Historic Site, which features\r\na recreation of the SS Klondike which used to travel the Klondike River between\r\nWhitehorse and Dawson City during the1920s. Whatever you choose to do in Alaska\r\nand Western Canada, there is no doubt that you will see some of the most\r\nspectacular and breath-taking scenery in the world.&nbsp;</p><p></p>\r\n","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"37bce081-3cef-42ab-8376-9b76833f3625","Slug":"alaska-by-james-michener","Title":"Alaska","Author":"James Michener","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:33:56.2057526Z"},{"Id":"7a1eac85-04c9-46c3-a4f8-e98459b4e0c2","Slug":"and-she-was-by-cindy-dyson","Title":"And She Was","Author":"Cindy Dyson","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:34:30.3127034Z"},{"Id":"7862d46c-5989-41bf-b87e-7b7e5abd1628","Slug":"drop-city-by-t-c-boyle","Title":"Drop City","Author":"T.C.

By far one of the most popular places in Bali is the\r\nisland of Nusa Lembongan, renowned for its laid back lifestyle, enviable surf\r\nand perfect beaches this is the place to head when all you really want is a\r\nsandy paradise, complete with crystal clear azure surf and the possibility of a\r\ndelectable cocktail or two.&nbsp; Lombok lures\r\nvisitors with its laid back charm and refreshingly undiscovered atmosphere in\r\ncomparison to the more built-up Bali.&nbsp;\r\nWith lush vegetation ranging from miles of paddy fields, to volcanic\r\nGunung Rinjani laced with brilliant hiking trails, there is a natural wonder\r\nhere to delight anyone’s taste.&nbsp; As in\r\nBali, the surf here is a huge draw here for those chasing the perfect wave and\r\nan endless summer, but there’s much more to Lombok than simply sun, sea, and\r\nsand although these are on excellent display in the idyllic Gili Islands.&nbsp; A tropical paradise which is far from the\r\nmaddening crowds, quite literally as there is no motorized traffic here, the\r\nGili Islands are instead populated by superlative diving opportunities with\r\ndeep water coral reefs, a heady underwater population of sharks, turtles and\r\nrays as well as beachside bungalows, bars and restaurants all of which combines\r\nto make these islands so hard to leave.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Java, the home island of Indonesia’s\r\ncapital city Jakarta is the heart of the country.&nbsp; Teeming with people, Jakarta and the island\r\nof Java are, together, one of the most densely populated places in the world\r\nbut don’t let this fact put you off.&nbsp;\r\nJakarta is something of an urban nightmare, positively pusling with\r\npeople, sights, smells and sounds in the way that super metropolises do and\r\nthere are few redeeming qualities, unless you are a seriously committed\r\nurbanite.&nbsp; It is far better to explore\r\nthe rest of the island of Java with its ring of volcanoes, lush, fertile\r\nvegetation, serene temples and views of the Indian Ocean.&nbsp; The beaches at Pangandaran are the perfect\r\nplace to experience this, and to revel in waterside tranquility and perfect\r\nbeaches and for something even more calming and awe inspiring visit the iconic Buddhist\r\ntemple of Borobudur, where watching a sunrise is in and of itself a religious\r\nand spiritual experience.&nbsp; Yogakarta\r\nforms the cultural heart of the island, where the fine balance between respect\r\nand honor for the city’s ancient past and the forward-looking approach to\r\nmodernity which can be found in most Asian cities is struck just right.&nbsp; To top off the perfect trip to Indonesia, a\r\nvisit to the legendary Komodo Island is a must.&nbsp;\r\nFamous not just for the Komodo Dragons, or giant lizards which hail from\r\nthis island, but also for being one of only a handful of places in the world\r\nwith a pink beach, Komodo Island is like something out of a picture book rather\r\nthan real life.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippines, much like Indonesia is a\r\nbeguiling formation of multiple islands within which you can expect to find a\r\nvast array of diversity, beauty, a warm welcome and the vast, high-rise filled,\r\nWesternized metropolis of Manila.&nbsp; Manila\r\nis a great place to learn about the country’s colonial past, and where the\r\nSpanish influence of that colonization is most obvious.&nbsp; From beautiful stone churches, to Intramuros,\r\narguably the Spanish heart of the city, and the educational Ayala Museum the\r\ncountry’s Spanish history is in evidence everywhere in the city and traditions\r\ncontinue elsewhere in the country as well, such as in the regular fiestas\r\nsmaller towns hold annually.&nbsp; To escape\r\nthe urbanity of Manila head to the Visayas which provide an idyllic retreat\r\nfrom the relentless pace of city life in Manila.&nbsp; As steeped in history as the capital the Visayas\r\nare also relentlessly beautiful, fulfilling even the pickiest of traveler’s\r\nideal of what paradisiacal beachside living should look like.&nbsp; Islands are filled with lush, tropical\r\ninteriors, palms fringe white sand beaches, which in turn lead down to perfect\r\nazure blue water and all are serviced by excellent beachside amenities.&nbsp; So, grab a pina colada, pick up a book, and\r\nsettle down to life in paradise.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Indonesia and the Philippines,\r\nMalaysia is a country of multitudes which contains contradictions, but also the\r\nwild jungles of Borneo, the friendly cosmopolitan lights of Kuala Lumpur, vast\r\ntea plantations in the Cameron Highlands and blissful white beaches.&nbsp; K.L. as its known to its friends, fans, and\r\nlocals is a truly 21<sup>st</sup> century Asian cosmopolis and as with many of\r\nthe continent’s vast metropolises it is a city in which the ancient, modern and\r\nfuturistic rub shoulders with one another.&nbsp;\r\nFrom the iconic twin Petronas Towers to the many mosques and temples which\r\nare scattered throughout the city, K.L. has one foot firmly in the past whilst\r\nthe other paves the way towards a bright, vertiginous future.&nbsp; Take in the view from the skyscraper Menara\r\nKL and see for yourself just how dizzying diverse this city is in, then take\r\nyourself over&nbsp; to the stunning Islamic\r\nArt Museum, which houses&nbsp; one of the\r\nfinest and most comprehensive collections of Islamic art in the world.&nbsp; After such excellent sightseeing, take a load\r\noff at one of the city’s <i>mamak</i>\r\nrestaurants where you can sample the best of the country’s cuisine, which over\r\nthe years has become a heady fusion of Asian influences from far across the\r\ncontinent, then wander in tranquil Lake Gardens Park where you can find some\r\nmuch needed peace and quiet from the fast paced hustle and bustle of 21<sup>st</sup>\r\ncentury cosmopolitan life.&nbsp; Visiting\r\nSabah in Malaysian Borneo means only one thing and that’s orangutans. Oh, and\r\nMount Kinabalu, and Kota Kinabalu, and the Danam Valley, and the Semporna\r\nArchipelago.&nbsp; There’s certainly a lot\r\ngoing on in this northern state and more than enough to keep any dedicated\r\nadventurer happy for quite some time.&nbsp; A\r\nvisit to the Sepilok Orangutan Sanctuary, however, is an absolute must, as is a\r\nstop in the capital of Kota which is an enviable mix of culture, urbanity,\r\nbeaches, bars and markets. Penang, an island off the northwest coast of the\r\nMalaysian peninsula is a veritable feast for all the senses and a culture\r\nlover’s dream.&nbsp; Known throughout Asia for\r\nits divine cuisine, there is also history and culture here a-plenty.&nbsp; Like K.L. Penang is a cultural melting pot\r\nwith a wide variety of influences and cultures from all across Asia, although\r\nChinese and Indian largely predominate along with the local Malaysian\r\nflavor.&nbsp; There are almost too many historically\r\nsignificant sites in Penang to count, but a good place to start is with Cheong\r\nFatt’s Mansion, built in 1896 this ornate palace was built by a man often\r\nreferred to as the Chinese Rockerfeller, which should give you some idea at\r\nleast of the man’s wealth and economic empire.&nbsp;\r\nThe mansion is an exercise in the ancient art of feng shui and serves to\r\nastound and amaze the various tourists and visitors who have since walked\r\nthrough its perfectly proportioned halls and rooms.&nbsp; The Penang Museum in the center of Georgetown\r\nis also a great way to get to know the cultural hot pot of the island, and a\r\nvisit to the Kek Lok Si Buddhist temple will give you some idea about the\r\nvarious religious influences felt in Penang.&nbsp;\r\nIt is also, in and of itself, an amazing architectural artifact.</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"ad8b911c-5cde-426d-a818-bc8fc0c7a12d","Slug":"a-most-peculiar-malaysian-murder-by-shamini-flint","Title":"A Most

A city which prides itself on being the\r\nheart of China, it is also the seat of power and has been since 1949, thereby\r\ninstilling in its citizens a sense of their own self-worth which often\r\ntranslates into an intense pride in their vast city.&nbsp; Beijing combines an ancient past, more recent\r\ntumultuous history, a heady present day and finger on the pulse of the future\r\nwhich all mixes up perfectly to make a cultural capital out of this vast\r\nmetropolis which is also most certainly a world city.&nbsp; Forging a path through the Forbidden City is\r\nan absolute must; this is where you can become an historical and cultural\r\nexplorer of this ancient palace complex and come face-to-face with a fascinating\r\nimperialistic history which was for many years sealed off from the public\r\n(hence its name).&nbsp; Built in the 15<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury, the Forbidden City was the palace seat for the Ming and Qing Dynasties\r\nand with entry strictly prohibited for over 500 years, there is a sense of\r\ndiscovering a secretive past when walking the hallowed halls of these imposing\r\npalaces.&nbsp; From Beijing, it is almost a\r\ncultural imperative to see one of the greatest man-made structures in the world,\r\nand visit the Great Wall. Although much of the wall was built during the Ming\r\nDynasty parts of it actually date as far back as the 7<sup>th</sup> century\r\nB.C. although little of the original fortifications still exist in their\r\noriginal incarnations.&nbsp; The Great Wall is\r\na formidable sight to behold and is as awe inspiring as any natural wonder,\r\nespecially when considering how many hands have gone into building it over its\r\nlong, long history.&nbsp; Built initially to\r\nprotect the country against intrusions from various nomadic peoples, it is now\r\none of the most popular tourist destinations in China, and once you have seen\r\nit for yourself you will begin to understand why. For culture vultures, back in\r\nthe heart of China’s capital, visits to the Summer Palace, Temple of Heaven and\r\nTiananmen Square should be on your to-do list, but make sure to also head down\r\nthe spindly alleyways known as hutong, where the real heart of Beijing resides,\r\nmaking sure to make a quick pit-stop at the cool bars and cafes of Nanluogu\r\nXiang’s hutong.&nbsp; Elsewhere in China explore\r\nthe port cities of Dalian and Qingdao, where you can also enjoy a little\r\nrelaxing beach time on the golden, sandy shores of Phoenix Island.&nbsp; Alternatively, spend time in one of China’s\r\nmost alluring and livable cities, Xiamen in the province of Fujian.&nbsp; Xiamen has the type of old-world charm rarely\r\nfound or seen in any other Chinese city, especially one of its size which is\r\none of the main aspects of its appeal.&nbsp;\r\nWith a beautiful, bustling waterfront, ancient temples, and the\r\nsurrounding environment of the lush vegetation of Fujian, there is little here\r\nto disappoint.&nbsp; From here it is essential\r\nthat you take the time to visit Gulung Yu Island, which once played host to the\r\ncolonial powers and visitors of Britain and Japan, there is much to see here\r\nincluding colonial mansions, winding alleys and crumbling architectural\r\nbeauties long past their hey-day.&nbsp;\r\nWandering around this charmingly antiquated island is like stepping back\r\nin time to a China long since forgotten elsewhere in the country. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first glance, Hong&nbsp; Kong has much in common with Shanghai; a\r\nfrenetic pace of life, soaring high rises, a penchant for neon signage,\r\nsmatterings and scatterings of antiquity almost covered by the sheen and shine\r\nof modern living, a dizzying harbor, and yet here East meets West even more\r\nobviously, even more keenly&nbsp; than in\r\nShanghai.&nbsp; Having been a British colony\r\nand now residing as a special administrative region under Chinese rule, Hong\r\nKong shows signs of both sides of its heritage with pride, which means you’re\r\nable to follow a divine lunch of dim sum with a pleasant afternoon tea at the\r\nPeninsula Hotel without breaking a sweat, or a local batting an eyelid.&nbsp; To really appreciate the skyline of what is\r\none of the most densely populated cities in the world, a trip up The Peak is second-to-none,\r\nalthough the view from Victoria Harbor in one of the city’s iconic junks comes\r\npretty close.&nbsp; For those in need of a\r\nlittle spiritual healing, or alternatively a view into the religious past of\r\nthe city, head to Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple which is by far the most\r\ninteresting and visit-worthy in the city.&nbsp;\r\nThe markets of Kowloon and the Temple Street Night Market are an\r\nabsolute must; at the latter you must be prepared to confront sights, sounds\r\nand smells you wouldn’t normally expect to see at a market, but it’s a great\r\nplace to embrace the culture and lifestyle of HK, and to appreciate the city’s\r\ndazzling display of life and vibrancy.&nbsp;\r\nFor something a little different allow time to visit the outlying islands\r\nwhere you will be able to witness more traditional local color, lush\r\nvegetation, misty mountain tops and tranquil Buddhist temples.&nbsp; Whilst loading up on the delights of the\r\nEast-meets-West smorgasbord of Hong Kong why not take the trip to enticing Macau\r\nand do the same there?&nbsp; A former\r\nPortuguese colony, Macau is equally beguiling, if not more so, than HK.&nbsp; With a stunning, ancient, colonial\r\narchitectural heart which has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as\r\nwell as a distinctly Mediterranean feeling harbor and waterfront, matched with\r\nunprecedented growth and an obsession with luxury living and a high-life which\r\ncan only be afforded by the city’s casino’s high-rollers, Macau is a\r\nmultifaceted place with a penchant to confuse and spellbind its visitors in\r\nequal measure.&nbsp; A trip to the shores of\r\nthis pleasure loving city is surely one not to be forgotten.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Taiwan head to the heart of the country\r\nand its capital Taipei, where you can visit the visually unique 17<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury temple Longshan, which has Buddhist, Taoist, and folkloric\r\ninfluences,&nbsp; making it one of the more\r\narresting temples to visit in the city.&nbsp;\r\nFrom there&nbsp; head to the Palace\r\nMuseum, where various ancient artifacts now reside in peace and safety, having\r\nbeen carried all through China throughout the Sino-Japanese War.&nbsp; As with many large Asian cities, Taiwan is a\r\ncity of contradictions, where ancient antiquities jostles alongside sleek\r\nmodernity and crisp cosmopolitanism, here you will find the likes of the iconic\r\nTaiwan 101 skyscraper which used to be the world’s tallest building as well as\r\nthe stunning Confucius Temple which dates back to 1665.&nbsp; From Taipei visit Wulai, a lush oasis which\r\nprovides the perfect retreat from the rush and rhythm of the city with its\r\nfertile vegetation, abundance of wildlife, hike-able trails, and secret\r\nswimming holes.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"b6333ae8-7bdc-4618-aa2c-506bb412237b","Slug":"a-many-splendored-thing-by-han-suyin","Title":"A Many Splendored Thing ","Author":"Han Suyin","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:38:51.0796184Z"},{"Id":"2b8db906-ec20-4c62-a20b-420032117c4b","Slug":"beijing-coma-by-ma-jian","Title":"Beijing Coma","Author":"Ma Jian","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:38:54.0997912Z"},{"Id":"18b717c6-fa00-48df-94a6-cf32969a0736","Slug":"beijing-doll-by-chun-sue","Title":"Beijing Doll ","Author":"Chun Sue","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:38:57.2419709Z"},{"Id":"69255838-4778-4257-af55-f3ed3d434774","Slug":"chinese-cinderella-by-adeline-yen-mah","Title":"Chinese Cinderella","Author":"Adeline Yen Mah","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:00.3691497Z"},{"Id":"6fa2cc09-2427-441a-a20a-8955dacfc6dd","Slug":"fragrant-harbor-by-john-lanchester","Title":"Fragrant Harbor ","Author":"John Lanchester","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:03.7753446Z"},{"Id":"3400e32f-8d44-48ec-a936-3944830937e3","Slug":"hong-kong-by-jan-morris","Title":"Hong  Kong","Author":"Jan Morris","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:06.8705216Z"},{"Id":"df954875-3e4b-4495-bf52-f6f99199954a","Slug":"kowloon-tong-a-novel-of-hong-kong-by-by-paul-theroux","Title":"Kowloon Tong: A Novel of Hong Kong","Author":"by Paul Theroux","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:10.1577096Z"},{"Id":"86f6f049-3968-46c0-8451-bd9bca10772f","Slug":"love-in-a-fallen-city-by-eileen-chang","Title":"Love in a Fallen City ","Author":"Eileen Chang","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:13.4658988Z"},{"Id":"7e3e33ba-c289-42b6-bdae-a2511b6b1dd7","Slug":"old-filth-by-jane-gardam","Title":"Old Filth ","Author":"Jane Gardam","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:16.7480866Z"},{"Id":"ce827e6b-ccdd-4283-978a-e8574eddd870","Slug":"red-sorghum-by-mo-yan","Title":"Red Sorghum","Author":"Mo Yan","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:20.1592817Z"},{"Id":"e80d1f61-a292-440d-82da-8f521939bad3","Slug":"river-town-by-peter-hessler","Title":"River Town","Author":"Peter Hessler","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:23.2674595Z"},{"Id":"89f5fa8d-51f7-489a-b3bc-ad8698ade2b4","Slug":"soul-mountain-by-gao-xingjian","Title":"Soul Mountain","Author":"Gao Xingjian","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:26.8796661Z"},{"Id":"033e29c5-d766-4cd0-9b82-cd593123b62f","Slug":"the-bonesetters-daughter-by-amy-tan","Title":"The Bonesetter’s Daughter","Author":"Amy Tan","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:30.61988Z"},{"Id":"a81fe590-5df1-4b91-9c56-224d718bfffb","Slug":"the-honorable-schoolboy-by-john-le-carre","Title":"The Honorable Schoolboy ","Author":"John Le Carre","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:34.064077Z"},{"Id":"121ad920-2fdc-4bc5-9b0d-4afcc0e35a12","Slug":"the-monkey-king-by-timothy-mo","Title":"The Monkey King ","Author":"Timothy Mo","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:39:37.5452761Z"},{"Id":"3faa508a-219a-4097-9fd3-b2c32b57a45e","Slug":"the-painted-veil-by-w-somerset-maugham","Title":"The Painted Veil","Author":"W.

This is a landscape to revel in, where the word ‘awesome’&nbsp; can be put to its proper use again, but also\r\nwhere you can explore the local way of life and experience the warm welcome of\r\nlocals who are as proud of their country and heritage as you are awe inspired\r\nby the region’s legion of natural wonders.&nbsp;\r\nPeru’s capital city may in fact be one of the only spots in this\r\nmagnificent and majestic country where natural beauty does not abound.&nbsp; Eschewed by travelers and tourists for years\r\ndue to its rough and tumble aspect and distinct lack of architectural beauty or\r\nimport, Lima is coming back into fashion thanks to the realization that the\r\ncity is simply simmering with cultural significance, and in fact has an\r\nextremely healthy artistic and cultural scene for you to explore.&nbsp; It is also currently something of an\r\nepicurean’s dream thanks to a vibrant restaurant and foodie scene which is\r\ncurrently experiencing a boom. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chile, at 4300km long is the longest\r\nNorth-South country in the world, and to just look at it on a map appears to be\r\nlargely made up of coast.&nbsp; Famous for\r\nEaster Island, and more recently for being a fine producer of New World wines,\r\nChile has much to offer by way of physical beauty, cultural history, and a\r\ncharming welcome which will leave you wanting to come back for more.&nbsp; Valparaiso is a popular place to start in\r\nChile, a busy port city chock full of character and colorful characters as well\r\nas its famous brightly colored houses, Valparaiso is known for its bohemian\r\nlaid back lifestyle and its vibrant, infectious attitude.&nbsp; Get to know the history of the area with a\r\ntour of the docks and a visit to the Maritime Museum, then indulge your\r\nimagination in an alternative history to the city with the ever-popular Pirate\r\nTour which provides a truly unique window into the world of this superlative\r\nport of call.&nbsp; For the ultimate view of\r\nValparaiso, however, it is a tour to top of the Cerro Concepción which provides\r\npanoramic vistas of the city.&nbsp; You can\r\nascend to the pinnacle of the peak either in an energetic hike, or on the much\r\nmore relaxed funicular, but either way you make it up there, you’ll want to\r\nindulge not just in the stunning views, but in one of the cafes or restaurants which\r\ncan be found there.&nbsp; In Peru you can live\r\nlike a castaway on Robinson Crusoe Island or visit San Pedro de Atacama which\r\nis a hotspot for tourists and travelers drawn to the area for its geographical\r\nsplendors such a salt flats, erupting geysers, and hopefully not erupting\r\nvolcanoes, combined with the promise of a bit of affordable luxury in this\r\nalluring resort town full to bursting with divine guesthouses and sumptuous\r\nrestaurants.&nbsp; But be sure not to miss out\r\non a trip to the famous Easter Island or Rapa Nui to give it its Polynesian\r\nname, which is easily one of the most beguiling and spell binding places in the\r\nworld.&nbsp; An isolated and largely desolate\r\nisland cast adrift in the Pacific Ocean, Rapa Nui is, unsurprisingly perhaps, a\r\nUNESCO World Heritage Site, with its famous <i>moai</i>\r\nstatues made by the early Rapanui people; incredible statues which dot the\r\nlandscape.&nbsp; The archipelago of Chiloé is\r\na traveler’s dream, combining lush verdant scenery and original, local culture\r\nwith a flair for vibrant culinary dishes focused mainly on the fresh seafood\r\nwhich can be found in abundance, as well as a fascinating architectural\r\nheritage most famous for its wooden houses on stilts, and beautiful wooden\r\nchurches which have been marked out as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.&nbsp; There is a fantastical element to these\r\nislands, which even the wear and tear of time has not been able to wash away;\r\nthis is an archipelago founded on mythical mysticism, witchcraft and\r\nspirituality, making it a truly sensational place to spend time.&nbsp; For a sense of myth and mysticism on an even\r\ngrander scale, the sights, sounds and smells of Patagonia are not to be\r\nmissed.&nbsp; A vast, sprawling area which\r\ntakes up a large part of Chile’s landscape it is the kind of scenery which\r\nneeds to be seen to be believed.&nbsp;\r\nMountains extend into mountains, jagged peak upon jagged peak and barren\r\nand bare highways means that this can often feel like the road to nowhere; but\r\nif this is nowhere, it’s a nowhere well worth visiting.</p></p><p></p>\r\n","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"0467ab95-667a-4079-ae0e-e6ae2fda3d80","Slug":"aunt-julia-and-the-scriptwriter-by-mario-vargas-llosa","Title":"Aunt

From its buzzing\r\nand bustling resorts, to the spectacular views from the islands’ volcanic\r\npeaks, to witnessing the bizarre luna-like landscape of Lanzarote in person,\r\nthere’s something on these islands to please everyone.&nbsp; Reveling and delighting in year-round sun,\r\nthe islands are often a popular spot for catching some winter sun and lapping\r\nup those rays, especially as a steady stream of tourism over the years has\r\nresulted in a sturdy service industry and a warm welcome from the locals.&nbsp; Especially popular with British tourists\r\nattempting to gain some respite from wind and rain battered winters, there are\r\na myriad of ways to be entertained in the Canaries, ensuring you will leave\r\nfeeling relaxed, refreshed and invigorated.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Canaries have the benefit of feeling\r\nand looking like an exotic location combined with a European atmosphere and\r\nlifestyle, so you can get the both worlds; perfect island weather and sunny\r\nshores with European cosmopolitanism and a comfort and ease of travel.&nbsp; Seven islands make up the archipelago, Gran\r\nCanaria, where the capital Las Palmas is, Lanzarote, Tenerife, &nbsp;El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera and\r\nFuertaventura, with Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Tenerife being the most popular\r\nwith tourists.&nbsp; Start exploring these\r\nextraordinary islands with a visit to Gran Canaria’s Dunas de Maspalamas on the\r\nsouthern shore of the island.&nbsp; The entire\r\nbeach feels like a desert by the sea making for truly spectacular scenery and a\r\nslightly surreal seaside experience; one which can’t be recreated anywhere and which\r\nyou’re not likely to forget easily.&nbsp; Away\r\nfrom the coast, visit the town Teror in the center of the island, a place\r\nsteeped in history away from it all up the steep winding roads of the island.&nbsp; With its local architecture typical to the\r\nCanaries it’s a great place to learn the history of the islands and to immerse\r\nyourself in the culture of the place.&nbsp;\r\nAlso away from the coast is wine country, where vines grow happily in\r\nthe sunshine and where you can also explore Caldera de Bandama, an enormous\r\ncrater at the bottom of which you may well find one of the oldest wine presses\r\non the island.&nbsp; Back on the beach and you\r\ncan relax and unwind Puerto de las Nieves, a great spot with a harbor from\r\nwhich you can watch people at play, the sun sink behind the craggy mountains in\r\nthe distance, and the boats sail in and out of the harbor from the safety of a\r\ndelightful seaside bar, café or restaurant from which there are many to choose\r\nfrom.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The easternmost island of Lanzarote is also\r\nthe most geologically and geographically unique of the Canaries.&nbsp; With a lunar-like landscape unlike anywhere\r\nelse in the world, the island is covered in volcanic formations and the island\r\nwas granted a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1993.&nbsp;\r\nThis has secured the continuing protection and preservation of the\r\nisland’s natural formations which extends to a large variety of endemic fauna;\r\nin fact there are more endemic species unique to Lanzarote than in the whole of\r\nEurope combined, making the island a real gem to nature lovers.&nbsp; Activities such as hiking and trekking are\r\npopular, especially considering the exciting terrain and incredible views that\r\nhiking in the volcanic hill formations provides.&nbsp; There are also, however, a lot of\r\nopportunities for water sports and activities, with sailing being particularly\r\ngood off the island, as well as parasailing, kite and wind surfing, as well as\r\nsurfing.&nbsp; The beaches aren’t just for the\r\nperennially active though; Lanzarote and the Canaries in general pride itself\r\non being a destination for vacationers to unwind; a place where you can just be\r\nyourself.&nbsp; With crystal clear waters and an\r\naverage year round temperature of 67°F you’ll find it impossible not to dip at\r\nleast your toe in.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the center of Tenerife is the highest\r\npeak in Spain, Teide mountain is also a National Park and has been declared a\r\nworld heritage site, and if you’re feeling particularly active and adventurous\r\nyou can scale this majestic mountain.&nbsp;\r\nYou can, however, climb up to 3,555 meters via cable car, allowing\r\nanyone and everyone to enjoy truly stunning views of the island from the\r\nRambleta.&nbsp; There is also the option to\r\nwhale and dolphin watch off the island, and it’s a popular spot for scuba\r\ndivers too.&nbsp; Tenerife also sports some of\r\nthe best nightlife in the Canaries, making it particularly popular with young\r\nvacationers and ensuring that there’s always a great bar to pop into every\r\nevening.&nbsp; Beach life is incredibly\r\npopular in Tenerife with the majority of visitors to the island intent on\r\nlapping up as many rays as possible and as such the beaches can be busy, but\r\nthere are also picturesque towns and villages to explore with the historic\r\ncenter of La Orotava a fine example of such.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re a fan of long pristine beaches\r\nyou could do worse than to wash up on the shore of Fuerteventura.&nbsp; An island dedicated to water sports such as\r\nsailing and surfing there’s an energetic air to life on this fine island, but\r\nthere are also plenty of opportunities to relax and enjoy yourself.&nbsp; As with Lanzarote, Fuerteventura has been\r\ndeclared a biosphere reserve which means the unique and fascinating natural\r\nlandscape of the island is sure to be protected.&nbsp; There are pleasant fishing villages,\r\nseemingly endless stretches of white sandy beaches, great surf breaks and\r\nschools where you can pick up this adrenaline pumping sport, as well busy\r\nresorts with plenty of beach side amenities to entertain and amuse you.&nbsp; And if Fuerteventura is a surfer’s paradise,\r\nthen El Hierro is a diver’s paradise.&nbsp;\r\nWith divers flocking to its shores every year for some of the world’s\r\nbest diving this is the place to pick up this underwater adventure pastime, or\r\nto renew your interest in it.&nbsp; As with\r\nmuch of the rest of the Canaries, the island is a biodiversity haven, with\r\nendemic flora and a truly unique landscape which still looks almost exactly how\r\nyou might imagine it would have looked in prehistoric times.&nbsp; But Jurassic Park this isn’t, and the locals\r\nare on hand to give you a warm welcome, as well as a lesson in sustainability\r\nand preservation, determined as they are to keep their island as beautifully\r\nunique as it is and has always been.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>La Palma may well be known as ‘the pretty\r\nisle’ but it could also be known as the ‘secret isle’, being as&nbsp; it is one of the least visited of the Canary\r\nIslands.&nbsp; Seeing as it is simply fit to\r\nbursting with natural beauty, stunning beaches, volcanic peaks, and the\r\noccasional ravine there is more than enough to keep you busy on a trip to La\r\nPalma.&nbsp; La Gomera rounds out the roster\r\nof seven sister islands which make up the Canaries, and is just as beautiful\r\nand unique in landscape as the rest.&nbsp; As\r\nquiet as La Palma, La Gomera is a UNESCO World Heritage Site like Lanzarote and\r\nis particularly proud of both is natural biodiversity and commitment to\r\nsustainable living and preservation of its natural wonders and resources.&nbsp; In the Canaries you are never far from a\r\nunique natural wonder, something which helps to make a trip to the islands a\r\ntruly unique and invigorating experience in this land of eternal spring.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"7bdf7e27-8b6b-49c8-937b-bb553f88da37","Slug":"canary-islands-song-by-robin-jones-gunn","Title":"Canary Islands Song","Author":"Robin Jones Gunn","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:37:56.1934791Z"},{"Id":"06ca383b-5669-405c-8056-ca3f2bbc385d","Slug":"grand-canary-by-a-j-cronin","Title":"Grand Canary","Author":"A.J.

has so intrigued and enthralled film lovers for decades.&nbsp; Old and new, ancient and modern, the past,\r\npresent and future collide in Casablanca, which is the economic center of\r\nMorocco and yet also manages to retain its ancient heritage and honor its\r\nfascinating past.&nbsp; This is a sprawling\r\nmetropolis, one which is rapidly becoming an important African city of global\r\nsignificance rather than a tourist trap intent on drawing in the traveling masses,\r\nand yet it remains appealing, welcoming and a fascinating historic center in\r\nwhich to wander.&nbsp; It also a great place\r\nto get to know North Africa as it is one of the most Westward looking cities in\r\nthe region, welcoming both of Western vacationers and cultural influences.&nbsp; The center of the city is really where the\r\narchitectural gems can be found here, and you will be woefully remiss not to\r\nspend some time gazing in awe at the Hassan II Mosque, which is one of the two\r\nmain mosques in Morocco which are open to non-Muslim visitors.&nbsp; The design and architecture of the vast\r\nbuilding is second to none, with a tall minaret and stunning Islamic art.&nbsp; For more compelling ancient architecture head\r\nto the Old Medina and the Mahkama du Pacha building which is a vast Moorish\r\nbuilding of fascinating design and architecture, with intricate wood carvings,\r\nostentatious floor and wall tiling in the typical Moorish designs and patterns\r\nand ornate iron railings and fixtures.&nbsp;\r\nThis is a veritable treasure trove of design for any culture vulture and\r\na great stop on a tour of Casablanca for anyone wishing to get a greater sense\r\nof the city’s history.&nbsp; Tangier is\r\npossibly Morocco and North Africa’s most famous port city.&nbsp; A bubbling, buzzing and bustling mix of\r\nFrench, Spanish and North African influences this has long been the entryway to\r\nNorth Africa for many Europeans and Westerners.&nbsp;\r\nThis much is in evidence at the Tangier American Legation Museum which\r\nis the only historical American landmark outside of the U.S.&nbsp; For something more authentically Moroccan you\r\ncan do no better than a trip to the legendary Kasbah of Tangier.&nbsp; Explore the warren like ancient complex which\r\nincludes the beautiful Sultan’s Garden and a fabulous museum which used to act\r\nas a sultan’s palace.&nbsp; From the apex of\r\nthe complex you can expect to see sweeping vistas of the entire city and on a\r\ngood day can even see Spain across the Strait of Gibraltar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Casablanca, Tunis, Tunisia’s capital\r\ncity combines the old and the new and has fashioned an identity for its self as\r\ncontemporary cosmopolitan center for North Africa which is a mixture of\r\nforward-looking growth and innovation and yet still exudes the ancient history\r\nand North African influences which make it unique.&nbsp; As with Morocco’s Tangier, Tunis is also\r\ngreatly influenced by its proximity to Mediterranean Europe and in particular\r\nby Italian and French cuisine.&nbsp;\r\nTraditional Tunisian cuisine still prevails, however and you would be\r\nremiss not to indulge in some typical Maghrebi dishes whilst staying in Tunis.&nbsp; From here you can also visit some of\r\nTunisia’s finest historical sites of significance such as the Ruins of Carthage\r\nwhich can be reached by rail, offering an authentic view of the country.&nbsp; The Ruins include 10 spectacular sites of\r\nancient and antique history from the Antonin Baths to the Ampitheater and\r\nBasilica of Saint-Cyprian providing comprehensive and extensive insight into\r\nthe ancient civilization of North Africa.&nbsp;\r\nAlso away from the center of Tunis, the picturesque village of Sidi Bou\r\nSaid is well worth a visit for its view of the Mediterranean, charming rustic architecture\r\nof blue and white houses, and the fascinating Family House Museum which\r\nprovides information on and insight into life in 18<sup>th</sup> century\r\nTunisia, particularly as it impacted the family and family life.&nbsp; Back in central Tunis be sure not to miss out\r\non either the Souq where you can haggle with sellers and pick up a few\r\ntreasures and souvenirs to take back home, or the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, which was\r\nbuilt in the 8<sup>th</sup> century by stone from Carthage and is a magnificent\r\nplace of worship to gaze upon in awe and wonder despite not being open for\r\nentry by non-Muslims.&nbsp; Sousse is an\r\nancient, beachside wonderland for weary travelers and vacationers in search of\r\na bit sun and rest and relaxation.&nbsp; The\r\nancient city plays host to its fair share of tourists every year and has become\r\na mecca for those craving a bit of pampering after the wearying hustle and\r\nbustle of North Africa’s large and hectic cities.&nbsp; This is a place to relax in and enjoy at your\r\nleisure; wander the town at dusk, admiring the Great Mosque and the 7<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury Tower of the Ribat, before settling down to a delicious meal of fresh\r\nseafood.&nbsp; A visit to the Medina is an\r\nabsolute must having been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site as well as\r\nproviding ample opportunity for a little retail therapy and within the confines\r\nof the Kasbah lives a most excellent archaeological museum with a stunning\r\ndisplay of ancient frescoes and mosaics.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Egypt has ‘history-buff’s dream’ written all\r\nover it; the name alone is enough to conjure up images of ancient pyramids, the\r\nageless Nile, beautiful minarets and antique cities teeming with as much\r\nhistory as there are people.&nbsp; We may have\r\nlearned about the Pharaohs and Cleopatra as children, but there is little\r\ncomparison to seeing these ancient relics, bustling city centers, or the slow,\r\nsluggish route of the Nile towards the sea in person.&nbsp; Founded by Alexander the Great, Alexandria is\r\none of the busiest ports in North Africa and is a buzzing city with plenty to\r\noffer in the way of historical attractions and sites.&nbsp; The labyrinthine, subterranean catacombs\r\nwhere the city’s ancient rulers were once buried provide insight into the\r\ncountry’s ancient attitudes towards death and royalty.&nbsp; Tread the underground hall ways which likely\r\ndate back to the 2<sup>nd</sup> century A.D. and witness for yourself the eerie\r\natmosphere and ancient mystery of the place.&nbsp;\r\nYou can also see Roman ruins in the city, those of Kom El Dikka which\r\nwere only discovered in the 1960s and display streets, a theater and villa\r\nwhere you can even see the original mosaic flooring.&nbsp; But there’s more to Alexandria than ancient\r\nhistory for this a city very much rooted in the here and now.&nbsp; A large metropolis by any standards,\r\nAlexandria is also increasingly cosmopolitan with a forward-looking attitude\r\nand hip heart.&nbsp; There are grand squares\r\nlined with trendy coffee shops where you can buy delicious pastries, and\r\nstunning <i>belle époque</i> architecture to\r\ngawp at when wandering the busy streets.&nbsp;\r\nElsewhere in Egypt take the time to take a dip off the coast of Sharm El\r\nSheikh where the diving opportunities are so good fans of the area just keep\r\ncoming back for more.&nbsp; The Old Town of\r\nSharm El Sheikh is also well worth a visit for anyone who wants to get under\r\nthe skin of this ancient and charming city.&nbsp;\r\nFor the more adventurous and active, a trek to the peak of legendary\r\nMount Sinai is like nothing else on earth; offering not only stunning vistas\r\nand truly incredible landscape, but believed also to be the spot where Moses\r\nreceived the Ten Commandments, whatever your religion or beliefs this is a\r\nplace steeped in spirituality, history and great, ancient significance.&nbsp; From the warm beaches of Ain Sukhna it is\r\nimperative for anyone wishing to get the full view of Egypt to take the trip to\r\nthe cosmopolitan and fascinating capital of Cairo where you can experience the\r\ndelights of the Egyptian Museum, the Coptic Museum, the Al-Azhar Mosque and the\r\nCitadel of Mohammed Ali Pasha as well as to the Pyramids of Giza which are sure\r\nto awe, inspire, and amaze in equal measure.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"b0191d16-768c-4c0d-8543-156defe9cec1","Slug":"death-on-the-nile-by-agatha-christie","Title":"Death On The

in search of something completely different, intent upon discovering a\r\nworld which is quite simply a world away from their own.&nbsp; It rewards adventure seekers and cultural\r\ndiscoverers who feel no qualms about immersing themselves in a culture so\r\ndifferent from what they are used to.&nbsp;\r\nJapan is an excellent spring board from which to dive into the Far East;\r\na nation which performs on the world stage, benefits from its own distinct\r\nculture and yet is also extremely welcoming of Western influences, and offers a\r\nsurfeit of diverse attractions, from the massive metropolis of Tokyo, to the\r\nsnow covered slopes of Mount Fiji.&nbsp; It’s\r\ntime to take another look at Asia, and prepare to jump right in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A visit to Japan is best begun in the wild,\r\nbustling, cosmopolitan city streets of one of the world’s biggest, busiest and\r\nmost beguiling capital cities, Tokyo.&nbsp;\r\nTokyo is both the world’s most populous and largest metropolitan area\r\nwith a population of 35 million people making it a singularly unique place to\r\nvisit.&nbsp; This is a city both at the\r\nforefront of modernity, cutting edge technology, with a finger on the pulse of\r\ncurrent and future trends, and yet still steeped in history; a veritable\r\nbubbling cauldron of culture.&nbsp; Amid the\r\ndense warren like realm of modern skyscrapers, flashing lights, and vibrantly\r\ndressed locals, be sure not to miss the more traditional sights of Senso-ji\r\nTemple, the most visited and admired in Japan, which dates back to the 7<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury, as well as the wonderfully informative Tokyo National Museum which\r\nhouses countless collections and works of art from all over the world, although\r\nfor obvious reasons it is the vast Japanese collection which is the most\r\nimpressive and where it is best to spend your time and attention.&nbsp; After honoring the tradition and ancient\r\nhistory of Japan at the National Museum, head to the Ghibli Museum for an in\r\ndepth look at one of Japan’s most interesting creative exports and pop cultural\r\ndevelopments from the mastermind behind the simply beautiful anime film <i>Spirited Away</i>.&nbsp; For something a little different visit the\r\nfamous Tsukiji fish market at dawn for a taste not just of the freshest sushi\r\nyou are ever likely to have, but also of an alternative and authentic Tokyo you\r\nwould otherwise miss out on.&nbsp; For further\r\ninsight into Tokyo’s alternative youth culture head to Shibuya where street\r\nfashion trends are born and worn as quickly as they disappear; here, at the\r\nforefront of trendsetting, fashion is as ephemeral as it is material.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mizayaki offers something completely\r\ndifferent, a world away from the intense metropolitan lifestyle of Tokyo.&nbsp; With its heat, humidity and proximity to the\r\nbeach, this is a surfing hotspot for surfers of all abilities as well as a lush\r\nand verdant area full of great outdoor opportunities for fun and adventure,\r\nincluding a botanical garden, family friendly zoo and a world class golf\r\ncourse.&nbsp; The names of two of Japan’s\r\ncities are forever engraved on the world’s memory, that of Hiroshima and\r\nNagasaki; witnesses to two of the greatest humanitarian disasters of the 20<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury and tragic victims of the Atomic Bomb.&nbsp;\r\nBoth cities have taken great pains and consideration to rebuild from the\r\nground up, careful to both look to, respect and honor their troubled and tragic\r\nhistory and forge a brighter future for all.&nbsp;\r\nA visit to either Hiroshima or Nagasaki is no trouble-free tourist\r\nfriendly day trip, but it is nevertheless inspiring, elucidating and illuminating\r\nto witness the history of them both as well as their heroic attempts to pave\r\ntheir own way towards the future.&nbsp; Visits\r\nto their respective memorials are a must, the Peace Park in Nagasaki and the\r\nPeace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, but be sure to also spend time in the rebuilt\r\nand reconstructed parts of the cities where you can shop, eat, wander and even\r\npray at the stunning 17<sup>th</sup> century temple in Nagasaki, Sofuku-ji or\r\nthe lovingly restored and reconstructed Gokoku Shrine in Hiroshima.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Incheon in South Korea explore the\r\ncountry’s metropolitan heart and capital city of Seoul.&nbsp; A city full of people, towering buildings,\r\nbusy streets, sensational shopping opportunities, calming central parks and a\r\nfascinating and compelling history Seoul is a city not to be missed, although\r\nit is oft overlooked in the vast pantheon of Asian super-cities that there are\r\nto explore and discover.&nbsp; The National\r\nMuseum of Korea is a great place to start your exploration, with exceptional\r\nand educational exhibits ranging from a Fine Arts Gallery and artifacts from\r\nthe Paleolithic era and a brilliant Historic Gallery.&nbsp; Much like Japan, South Korea is exemplary in\r\ncarefully balancing a fascination, even obsession with modern, contemporary\r\nliving and all its technological and material accessories with a veneration and\r\nreverence for the past and tradition.&nbsp;\r\nSuch a fine balancing act may not be immediately obvious in the\r\nultra-modern 600 year old capital of Seoul, but the city’s ancient heart is\r\nstill alive and well and can best be experienced at Bukaksan, the city’s ancient\r\nfortress from which you can admire the sprawling city below in all its\r\npanoramic glory.&nbsp; After braving the buzz\r\nand bustle of the city’s shopping districts and gazing up at its soaring\r\nskyscrapers, take some time out to enjoy the tranquil energy of Changdeokgung,\r\nthe secret garden and be sure to get a more traditional shopping experience at\r\ncenturies old Namdaemun market.&nbsp; Busan\r\nhas the hustle and bustle of Seoul with the added benefit of a beachside\r\nlocation.&nbsp; Watch the glittering city\r\nskyline shimmer in the dark waters lapping at the shore, or alternatively come\r\nfor a sunny daytrip as a way to escape city sightseeing fatigue.&nbsp; If you’re in further need of some serious\r\nrest and relaxation head to the ever popular Spa at Heosimcheong,&nbsp; which is the largest hot-spring fed spa in\r\nAsia and has a vast complex including restaurants, cafes, nightclubs and a\r\nbakery as well as the sauna, mud bath, spa and massage facilities you would\r\nexpect from a world class spa destination.&nbsp;\r\nBeomeosa Temple is not to be missed in Busan, dating back to the 7<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury this is a Buddhist temple of the highest caliber, with stunning\r\nmid-Joseon dynasty architecture on display.&nbsp;\r\nExperience a completely different side to South Korea in Yeosu, a serene\r\nseaside town with a stunning shoreline scattered with lush islands, the truly\r\ntranquil Hyangiram hermitage at the summit of Mount Geumosan, the green\r\nterraces of Besong Tea Plantation and Dolsan Park.&nbsp; Just as in the rest of South Korea, there is\r\nsomething here for everyone.</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"3112d4a4-c9d0-404b-b72b-d7c411cf7274","Slug":"cloud-atlas-by-david-mitchell","Title":"Cloud

US","ParentDestinationName":"West Coast","ParentDestinationId":"aaa6068a1e6f75d5e64f5ef70f2b4300","Slug":"western-us","Description":"<p><p>Whether or not the West Coast is the Best Coast is for you\r\nto decide, but with cities as diverse and seductive as Vancouver, Seattle, San\r\nFrancisco and Los Angeles, not to mention the smaller towns of southern\r\nCalifornia, and the wineries of the north, the area offers up choice, style,\r\nand pleasure in abundance.&nbsp; A trip down\r\nthe West Coast is an epicurean’s delight, and a feast for the all the senses,\r\nalthough the taste buds will certainly be tickled and tantalised by the distinctive\r\nWest Coast dining experiences that can be found in Vancouver, Seattle and San\r\nFrancisco.&nbsp; Seafood is a must, of course,\r\nwhether sampling the fine dining on offer in all such cities, or wandering the\r\nfamous food markets of Granville Island in Vancouver or Pike Place in\r\nSeattle.&nbsp; Both cities boast a highly\r\ncaffeinated culture, with independent roasteries and coffee shops on almost\r\nevery corner, but if you’re a real coffee-nut, then a visit to the original Starbucks\r\njust opposite Pike Place Market is a must.&nbsp;\r\nThe highly caffeinated nature of the Seattle locals may help to explain\r\nwhy Tom and Meg were once so famously sleepless here, and a visit to the\r\nbeautifully positioned houseboat on Lake Union that Tom Hanks’ character Sam\r\nlived in is sure to sate the appetite of any movie buffs.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s more to Seattle and Vancouver than just coffee and\r\nfarmers’ market fresh food, however, as both are stunningly situated within the\r\notherworldly beauty of the Pacific North West.&nbsp;\r\nThis part of the world may be famous for its rainfall, but there’s\r\nenough distraction in Vancouver to shelter in, and the rain is such an integral\r\npart of life here you may even find yourself disappointed if you don’t get a\r\nchance to splash around in puddles in a shiny pair of gumboots bought from one\r\nof the city’s fine shopping emporiums.&nbsp; Surrounded\r\nby the mountains of Grouse, Cypress and Mount Seymour, the city’s culture and\r\natmosphere is beholden and inspired by both these mountains and the water which\r\nVancouver sometimes appears to float upon.&nbsp;\r\nThere’s an ultra-healthy, outdoorsy vibe to the city and even those not\r\nnormally taken to outdoor adventuring may very well find themselves attempting\r\nthe Grouse Grind in summer or taking on some downhill skiing or snowboarding\r\nwhilst watching the city’s lights start to flicker on in the gloaming of a\r\nwinter evening.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s more to Washington State than Seattle, as a trip to\r\nthe Olympic National Park will show you.&nbsp;\r\nWith natural beauty as lush and verdant as that found in Washington and\r\nin the area surrounding Port Angeles, you may find it hard to tear yourself\r\naway.&nbsp; A hike in the National Park can be\r\nfollowed by a kayaking trip through the waters of the San Juan Islands, and\r\nlater topped off with a delicious dinner at one of Port Angeles’ quaint\r\nrestaurants serving up local produce in innovative and invariably\r\nmouth-watering meals.&nbsp; Further south, the\r\nequally attractive smaller towns and cities in California offer up class,\r\nculture, and natural beauty all swathed and bathed in the famous Californian\r\nsunshine that keeps visitors coming back time and again.&nbsp; In Monterey to the south of San Francisco the\r\nworld famous Aquarium offers visitors a peek under the sea, as well as an\r\neducative look at how this part of the world has been shaped by the ocean.&nbsp; More on this topic can be explored at Cannery\r\nRow, where the area and buildings made famous by John Steinbeck’s novella have\r\nbeen maintained and restored,&nbsp; so that\r\nalthough they look how they might have done when the area’s main industry was\r\nthe sardine cannery, they actually hide a myriad of modern conveniences and\r\nretail opportunities. &nbsp;Close by to\r\nMonterey are several of the wineries this part of California is famous for, including\r\nthe award winning Ventana Vineyard.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Barbara and San Diego offer up loads of California\r\ncharm, sun, sea, and sand with both cities showcasing an enviable and seductive\r\nway of life.&nbsp; The downtown area of Santa\r\nBarbara is dominated by State Street which leads down to the beach side\r\npromenade, and is lined with dozens of delectable restaurants, artisanal\r\nbakeries and cafes, and enticing bars.&nbsp;\r\nThere’s plenty of shopping to be done in the area as well, but there’s\r\nalso beautiful architecture in abundance, such as the Santa Barbara Mission\r\nwhich is one of the best examples, and most lovingly maintained of California’s\r\nFranciscan Missions.&nbsp; Edged by the\r\nglittering azure of the Pacific Ocean on one side, and the majestic Santa Anza\r\nMountains on the other, Santa Barbara provides as many stimulating views and vistas\r\nas anyone could ask for.&nbsp; When in San\r\nDiego, a visit to the world renowned zoo is a must-do, but if it’s a relaxed,\r\nbeach vibe you’re after, you could do a lot worse than a visit to the Mission\r\nbeach area, where surfers and sun worshippers congregate on the shores of the\r\nPacific Ocean.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A visit to the West Coast of the United States wouldn’t be\r\ncomplete without taking a trip to San Francisco and Los Angeles.&nbsp; Both as unique and different as the other,\r\nit’s oft said that these two West Coast cities represent the two faces of\r\nCalifornia.&nbsp; With San Francisco the\r\nlighter hearted, literary, and foggier sister to the north, LA is of course the\r\nmore glamorous, but smoggier sister to the south.&nbsp; Compare the two equally, if differently,\r\nenchanting cities at your leisure; whether travelling by tram to Fisherman’s\r\nWharf, or exploring the City Light’s Bookstore in San Francisco, or living the\r\nhigh life in Hollywood, visiting the fantastic Getty museum in Santa Monica or\r\ntaking in the eccentrically thrilling views of Venice Beach in LA.&nbsp; There’s something for everyone in the two\r\nmost famous Californian cities, and with both surrounded by some of the most\r\nstunning natural beauty in the continental US, it would be a shame to waste the\r\nopportunity to visit Yosemite National Park, the Pacific Coast Highway, Santa\r\nCatalina Island or Joshua Tree National Park.</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"9141a441-8937-47ec-8fd8-a3243771db8f","Slug":"big-sur-by-jack-kerouac","Title":"Big Sur","Author":"Jack

India seethes and heaves with life, love\r\nand laughter.&nbsp; It is a no-holds-barred\r\nbarreling adventure through a tumultuous country steeped in history, tragedy,\r\nhope and optimism where diversity isn’t just a word, it is a way of life and\r\nwhere you will see the past and future rub up against one another, occasionally\r\nin harmony, occasionally in discord but always in a fascinating display of\r\ninnovation, tenacity and more often than not, searing beauty.&nbsp; India is a voyage of discovery, and from\r\nthere you can expect to also discover the joys of Sri Lanka, a country just\r\nstarting to come into its own as a tourist and travel destination after years\r\nof upheaval and war.&nbsp; This is a country\r\nto savor, with its stunningly pristine beaches, its superlative safari\r\nopportunities and second-to-none surf.&nbsp;\r\nIt is also a country of ancient beauty, however, with historical sites\r\na-plenty (including 8 UNSESCO World Heritage Sites and counting!) and natural\r\nwonders to behold, creating moments of awe and wonder which will turn into much\r\ncherished memories for years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For beach lovers in India there is only one\r\nplace to head; they must go to Goa.&nbsp; It\r\nhas long been known as a sandy haven, a pristine beachside heaven of wide white\r\nbeaches, fresh fish hauled in daily and served up in charmingly ramshackle huts\r\nand restaurants, calm surf and warm waters, and to top it all off a delightful\r\narray of wildlife, including a veritable feast for birdwatchers and\r\nlovers.&nbsp; Much of Goa at this time is, of\r\ncourse, built up with the secret of this paradisiacal destination having well\r\nand truly got out decades ago.&nbsp; It is,\r\nnevertheless, well worth the trip and not at all impossible to find more hidden\r\naway, secretive and secluded beaches from which you can easily imagine what the\r\narea was like all those years ago when Western hippies and travelers first\r\nstarted coming to these stunning shores.&nbsp;\r\nMobor, for example is a largely undisturbed beach, where you will be\r\nhappy to watch the tide, and the fisherman come in from a day of catching the\r\ncatch-of-the-day (to your epicurean delight, no doubt), whilst sunning yourself\r\non the white sand of a largely unspoiled beach.&nbsp;\r\nPalolem is one of the more popular beaches to visit, but no less\r\nalluring for all its immense popularity.&nbsp;\r\nLined with a mixture of ramshackle restaurants serving up fresh catches,\r\nand more upscale bars, clubs and cafes, this is a place for beach lovers who\r\nlike their sand with a side of socializing.&nbsp;\r\nIf you find yourself craving something a little more secluded, head to\r\nButterfly Bay, Colomb Bay, or Patnem Beach.&nbsp;\r\nAlternatively you can head to the larger state of Kerala which is famous\r\nfor its laid-back, happy and liberal attitude to both life and leisure.&nbsp; The beaches here as beautiful as those in\r\nGoa, with Varkala being a particular stand out destination beach, where cliffs\r\nfall dramatically into the shimmering sea, with only a strip of sand for you to\r\nsettle down on.&nbsp; From the cliffs watch\r\nthe setting sun whilst feasting on fragrant seafood and fresh fish and\r\ncontemplate, happy and full, the aesthetic beauty of such a stunning Indian\r\nstate.&nbsp; The ‘backwaters’ of Kerala, as\r\nthey are commonly known, are well worth a trip in to the interior where you can\r\nleisurely explore, from the stern of a homely houseboat, the fine tributaries, spindly\r\ncanals, and large lagoons which make up this spellbinding and bewitching system\r\nof waterways.&nbsp; Fort Cochin is also\r\nexceedingly popular with tourists and travelers, with a history stretching back\r\nover 600 years, during which it has played host to a vast array of merchants,\r\ntraders, travelers, tourists and of course locals, which has all gone into\r\nmaking it one of the most historically and architecturally diverse towns in\r\nIndia, if not the world.&nbsp; &nbsp;A unique blend of Portuguese, Dutch and\r\nEnglish heritage has combined with Keralan and Indian tradition to build a\r\ntruly magnificent city of art, culture and history.&nbsp; With its legendary serenity, heritage of a\r\nlaid back welcome to travelers, and stunning, ancient architecture this is a\r\ntown to savor, and one many find almost impossible to leave.&nbsp; It will certainly leave you rested,\r\nrejuvenated and in love with the state of Kerala.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere in India the Taj Mahal in Agra is\r\nan absolute must.&nbsp; Brave the crowds and\r\nthe hordes of tourists for a glimpse of the iconic, glistening white dome and\r\npush through the throngs in order to grace the halls of this truly majestic\r\npalace.&nbsp; The city can be visited in a day\r\nfrom the vibrant mega metropolis of Delhi, but it’s a worthwhile endeavor,\r\nbeing one of the most beautiful and awe inspiring man made sites in the\r\nworld.&nbsp; Unlike many much-hyped, legendary\r\ndestinations, the Taj Mahal more than lives up to even the most bloated of\r\nexpectations and there are also remnants of the Mughal Empire elsewhere in the\r\ncity such as forts and mausoleums which offer fascinating insight into the area’s\r\nhistory with far fewer tourist distractions than at the Taj.&nbsp; Delhi itself can be overwhelming, confusing\r\nand sometimes even bamboozling.&nbsp; A mass\r\nof people, cars, markets, rickshaws and a combination of historical, ramshackle\r\nand historic buildings, Delhi is overflowing with sights, sounds, and smells\r\nand many people come away from this mega metropolis needing a breath of fresh\r\nair and a spot of respite, but if you take the time to take in the view of\r\nDelhi, this is a city which really will reward you.&nbsp; Mumbai is hardly the place to escape to in\r\norder to escape the frenetic energy of Delhi, with its own secret blend of\r\nenergy, history and culture, the frantic pace of living here is just as high as\r\nin Delhi, but whereas Delhi may be the country’s capital it is Mumbai which\r\nreally feels like the cosmopolitan heart of the county.&nbsp; It is also where extreme wealth and extreme\r\npoverty rub up against one another in a worrying and often turbulent fashion.&nbsp; This is a city with a long, long history\r\nwhich is also struggling to find its feet in the present whilst simultaneously\r\nlooking forward to a future which seems just temptingly within reach of its outstretched\r\nhand.&nbsp; Mumbai is a city which seems to have\r\nalmost have been promised the riches of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, but with\r\nthe relics of past centuries constantly sitting on the periphery of this giant\r\ncity, that much-vaunted future may not come as easily as many had hoped.&nbsp; For something a little different and\r\ncertainly charmingly relaxing after the buzz and thrill of Delhi and Mumbai\r\nhead to the coastal city of Puducherry (formerly Pondicherry) on the southern\r\ncoast of the country.&nbsp; Having been\r\nsettled by the French in the 18<sup>th</sup>, a strong sense of Gallic charm\r\nand charisma still resides in the city, alongside the typical Indian background\r\nof this fine place.&nbsp; Witnessing this\r\ncollision of French and Indian culture is truly delightful and can be\r\nbrilliantly tasted and savored in the city’s exciting and excellent fusion\r\ncuisine.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a tourist destination Sri Lanka is\r\ncurrently just starting to get its sea legs.&nbsp;\r\nHaving been something of a no-go area for travelers in the past due to\r\nthe war it is just now starting to open up its delightful shores to\r\nadventurers, travelling discoverers and backpackers who will have previously\r\npassed over Sri Lanka on their itineraries.&nbsp;\r\nAn island nation ringed by stunningly beautiful beaches and with an\r\ninterior brimming with jungle and wildlife, Sri Lanka is one of the only places\r\nin the world where you will be in with a chance of sighting the elusive and\r\nenigmatic Leopard.&nbsp; Here the jungle\r\nsimply teems with fascinating wildlife, and safari trips into the thick\r\nforested areas on the country will leave you breathless with anticipation and\r\nexcitement.&nbsp; Yala National Park is the\r\nplace to take such a safari, but Horton’s Place and Land’s End should not be\r\nmissed in terms of natural beauty and wonder.&nbsp;\r\nBoth sites offer arresting sights and atmosphere, almost eerie in their\r\nplaintive silence and mystery as you survey the plain’s sheer drop into the\r\nbeautiful ocean below.&nbsp; Kandy is a\r\nparticularly popular urban spot to take in, with a charismatic and\r\nidiosyncratic eccentric atmosphere you can’t possibly find replicated\r\nelsewhere, known as the capital of the country’s Hill Country, Kandy is well\r\nknown for being laid-back and full of historical, cultural and cosmopolitan\r\ndelights.&nbsp; Colombo, Sri Lanka’s capital\r\nis a booming, buzzing, bustling city with a cultural and historical heart which\r\nwill no doubt reward you if you take the time to explore and get to know it.\r\nThere is a strong colonial heritage to the city, with a dash of great dining\r\nopportunities, whether street food or fine dining, as well as great shopping\r\nand historical sites such as Cinnamon Gardens, Pettah and Gangaramaya Temple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the last word in luxurious relaxation,\r\nupscale rejuvenation, and a picture perfect ideal of beachside living, the\r\nMaldives is the only destination for you.&nbsp;\r\nBeing a luxury destination for travelers from all over the world, in\r\nsearch of seclusion, romance, jaw droppingly beautiful beaches, enticing\r\nwildlife, the freshest of fresh fish, the Maldives is all about luxury, luxury,\r\nluxury.&nbsp; The Maldives is the trip of a\r\nlifetime for the majority of people who visit these shores, and it has yet to\r\ndisappoint. With a refreshingly warm welcome to its many tourists, the Maldives\r\nhas managed to combine a laid back attitude to its influx of diverse visitors\r\nwith its dedication to Islam all of which adds to its enduring charm.&nbsp; The relaxing energy of the place would the\r\nperfect antidote to the frenetic and frantic pace of life you will encounter in\r\nIndia, and will stay with you long after you’ve left its tranquil and teasingly\r\nstunning shores.&nbsp; These are islands of\r\nnatural beauty, bounty and wonder.&nbsp; Huts\r\non stilts sit pleasingly in the clearest, cobalt blue water you have ever seen,\r\nfrom the deck of a boat you will witness pools of manta rays, the sun pours\r\ndown on you year round, and the water is warm and welcoming.&nbsp; The scuba diving opportunities are second to\r\nnone, and for the less experienced or adventurous there are plenty of places to\r\nsnorkel.&nbsp; But the Maldives is really all\r\nabout relaxing in the kind of environment and atmosphere which can really only\r\nbe described as luxurious.&nbsp; So sit back,\r\nrelax and enjoy the view; you’re in Paradise.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"c43cf748-ab90-4147-b7de-5ceeadaaf335","Slug":"a-fine-balance-by-rohinton-mistry","Title":"A Fine Balance","Author":"Rohinton Mistry","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"LastUpdatedBy":"Cruise.Me.DataMigrator","LastUpdatedUtc":"2012-12-15T12:41:48.2377513Z"},{"Id":"511e82a2-6129-49e9-af9f-bac6dea2a0a5","Slug":"a-passage-to-india-by-e-m-forster","Title":"A Passage to India","Author":"E.M.

Both\r\ncountries attract vast numbers of tourists and travelers each year, drawn to\r\nthe carnival atmosphere of Rio, the tango of Buenos Aires, Amazonian adventure\r\nin Brazil, or the wilds of the Patagonian coast in Argentina.&nbsp; They say you haven’t truly traveled until\r\nyou’ve traveled to South America, so if you’ve yet to visit these two welcoming\r\nand yet wildly invigorating countries, now is the time to get on board.&nbsp; Also worth a visit are the smaller nations of\r\nFrench Guiana, Uruguay and the British Overseas Territory of the Falkland\r\nIslands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French Guiana is an overseas territory of\r\nFrance and benefits as such by being one of the most economically stable and\r\nfinancially successful of the South American countries in this region.&nbsp; It has been noted by travelers, however, to\r\nbe somewhat of a strange place to visit and spend time in, which might have\r\nsomething to do with having been largely settled by the colonial French as a\r\npenal colony.&nbsp; The country is most famous\r\nfor Devil’s Island, the island used as a penitentiary for political prisoners\r\nby France until 1953.&nbsp; Two of the\r\nisland’s most infamous inmates are Captain Alfred Dreyfus who was unjustly\r\ncharged with treason in 1895, and Henri Charriére, whose apparent escape from\r\nthe inescapable island was immortalized (and possibly fictionalized) in his memoir\r\n<i>Papillion</i>, which was later turned\r\ninto a movie starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman.&nbsp; Devil’s Island is part of a range of islands\r\nknown as Îles du Salut, all of which were used as a penal colony by the\r\nFrench.&nbsp; It is now possible to visit Devil’s\r\nIsland and learn more about the ‘Green Hell’ as it was known by its imprisoned\r\ninhabitants, and is in fact a particularly popular tourist destination.&nbsp; Many of the old prison buildings have been\r\nturned into informative museums, and the island itself exists as an\r\nextraordinary testament to what is now widely considered one of the most inhumane\r\npenal systems in history.&nbsp; Like visiting\r\nSouth Africa’s Robben Island, there is still much to learn about the way we\r\nlive, and the way have lived on this fascinating and rather chilling\r\nisland.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Away from the former penal colony and\r\nUruguay’s not-so-secret-secret is officially out of the bag; this is a traveler\r\nand tourist’s destination hot spot, the kind of place people used to whisper\r\nsurreptitiously about to friends back home they wanted to keep in the loop.\r\nNow, it is a fully fledged tourism destination, but no less beautiful,\r\nwelcoming or alluring for it.&nbsp; Uruguay\r\nhas succeeded where many hot destination countries have failed; it has\r\nweathered the tourism storm and kept its integrity and vibrant, passionate\r\nheart in-tact.&nbsp; This is a place to visit,\r\nfall in love with, and treasure forever, whether you’re visiting the charmingly\r\nand culturally eclectic capital of Montevideo, or the beautiful beachside\r\nresort town of Punta del Este.&nbsp; In\r\nMontevideo be sure to make time to visit Ciudad Vieja, or the Old Town, the\r\ncultural and historical heart of the city where the architectural history of\r\nthe city symbolizes the actual past of Uruguay and Montevideo.&nbsp; Art Deco architectural sensations sit\r\nalongside colonial and neoclassical beauties which in turn and borne down on by\r\nmid-century and 1960s style blocks which would probably look more at home in\r\nthe former Soviet Union.&nbsp; There has,\r\nhowever, been significant financial investment in the restoration of\r\nMontevideo’s architectural glories, and the area is currently experiencing a\r\nboon in the growth of trendy cafes, destination restaurants, and classy\r\nwatering holes.&nbsp; This city is a local and\r\ntourist favorite, with native city dwellers all too proud to declare the\r\nbrilliance of their city and share in its delights with you, but it’s also a\r\nbusy business, municipal and financial center so if you fancy something a\r\nlittle more relaxing, head to the resort town on Punta del Este.&nbsp; This is possibly South America’s most\r\nglamorous, luxurious, and exclusive resort where yachts jostle for prominence\r\nin the harbor, upscale bars and clubs line the beach front, luxury hotels hold\r\nforth and the rich and famous come to play; be warned, it’s expensive and\r\nexclusive but a whole lot of fun as well.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buenos Aires is the traveler’s, the eternal\r\nwanderlust enthusiast’s favorite city; the city which changes lives and minds,\r\ncapturing more than just picture perfect photos, but also imaginations and hearts,\r\nkeeping you coming back for more and daydreaming of this magically historical\r\nmetropolis long after you’re back at your desk.&nbsp;\r\nThis vibrantly breathtaking city is alive with color and a distinctive\r\npassion for life which cannot be replicated anywhere else in the world.&nbsp; The historic heart of the city can be found\r\naround Plaza Mayo where popular historical and tourist destinations cluster\r\naround this bustling square, including the Cabildo, the Casa Rosada, the\r\nMetropolitan Cathedral and the May Pyramid.&nbsp;\r\nThis is a great place to start in Buenos Aires, somewhere to get to know\r\nboth the people, and the colonial history of this architecturally beautiful\r\ncity.&nbsp; There is a European feel to the\r\ncity which permeates more than just the residual colonial buildings that serve\r\nto make the place feel imposing and yet welcoming, as the city combines a\r\nparticular familiarity with a brush of South American charm and charisma.&nbsp; And there is definitely a large dollop of\r\nSouth American charisma in the brilliantly beautiful area of La Boca, commonly\r\nconsidered Buenos Aires’ best local haunt by tourists and local natives\r\nalike.&nbsp; Painted in all the colors of the\r\nrainbow, La Boca is colorful in more ways than one as it is a bustling port\r\narea (the brightly colored houses are said to have been painted initially by\r\nthe fisherman who first made this part of the city home), but is most famously\r\nalso the home of the definitive Argentinian dance, the Tango.&nbsp; And if you’re really lucky you may even be\r\nwitness to a street side demonstration of the passionate, local dance.&nbsp; Wander in the brilliantly bohemian\r\nneighborhood of Palermo Soho, which is a real locals’ favorite and admire and\r\nperuse the countless restaurants, cafes, and shopping opportunities whilst\r\nbasking in the beauty of the city. But be sure not to miss out on a trip to the\r\nRecoleta cemetery which houses some Argentina’s famous dead including Eva\r\nPeron, as well as being rich with the history of both this fascinating country\r\nand endlessly intoxicating city. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much, much further south is the city of\r\nUshuaia, which has a real end of the road atmosphere, which can be accounted for\r\nby the fact that it is indeed the most southern city in the world.&nbsp; Set within the heart of the Tierra del Fuego\r\nprovince, Ushuaia and the rest of the province are separated from the Argentine\r\nmainland by the Strait of Magellan. The Tierra del Fuego National Park is an\r\nimportant part of the region, protecting and preserving as it does the\r\nSub-Antarctic forest which makes up much of the park and creates such a unique\r\nand beguiling landscape.&nbsp; With stunning\r\narchipelagoes, glaciers, snow-capped peaks (Cerro Castor is a popular skiing\r\nresort with Argentines) and fantastic wildlife watching opportunities, the area\r\nsurrounding Ushuaia is enchanting and awe inspiring in equal measure.&nbsp; When you’re in a part of the world from which\r\nit is possible to travel, quite literally to the ‘end of the world’, by\r\njourneying to Lapataia Bay you know you are somewhere really quite special\r\nindeed. There are all sorts of action adventures to be had in the area, from\r\nkayaking to horseback riding and hiking to mountain biking, so there’s always\r\nsomething to keep the adrenaline junkies happy.&nbsp;\r\nAnd with a buzzing small town atmosphere and brilliant microbrewery on\r\nhand, Ushuaia is a great place to kick back and relax after a hard day of\r\nadventuring.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Ushuaia it is possible to travel to\r\nthe historically disputed land of the Falkland Islands where you may encounter\r\npenguins at Gypsy Cove or walk through the wild and rugged Hadassa Bay in the Falklands\r\nNational Park.&nbsp; There are many species of\r\nbirds in the area, who are drawn to the uninhabited bay and which you will\r\nhopefully get the chance to spot in this secluded and wildly beautiful part of\r\nthe world.&nbsp; The city of Stanley on the\r\nFalklands is the only city in the archipelago, but here you can witness and\r\nlearn the history of the islands simply by wandering through the streets, or\r\nfor a more immersive pedagogic experience, visit the fascinating island museum.\r\nThe building of Christchurch Cathedral provides a poignant place to contemplate\r\nthe lived history of these islands, as you walk under the two giant whale bones\r\nwhich provide a gateway to the southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world, a\r\nperfect symbol for the meeting of North and South that occurs in the\r\nFalklands.&nbsp; There is plenty to do and see\r\nin this unique corner of the world, but here nature is king; whether hiking the\r\nrugged Atlantic coastline, wilderness fishing in one of the many rivers,\r\nestuaries or lakes, wildlife spotting in one of the more secluded areas, or\r\nsurfing some of the most pristine beaches and clean breaks in the world at the\r\nappropriately named Surf Bay there is enough nature to keep everyone happy and\r\nentertained.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brazil is a country that really packs a\r\npunch, with one of the fastest growing economies in the world, and booming\r\ntourism industry, Brazil really is one of the countries should be on the top of\r\neveryone’s bucket lists and now is the perfect time to visit.&nbsp; With the most famous carnival in the world,\r\nRio de Janiero is an exceedingly popular place to start, with the reputation of\r\na party town that has perfected beach side cosmopolitan life, Rio is much more\r\nthan the Christ the Redeemer statue and Sugarloaf Mountain, both of which stand\r\nguard over this eccentric and adrenaline pumping city.&nbsp; That is not to say, of course, that both of\r\nthese popular destinations are not worth a visit; in fact you’d be a fool to\r\nmiss out on them on a trip to Rio! Copacabana beach is also a must-do, being\r\none of the most&nbsp; famous beaches in the\r\nworld, with a wide sandy crescent of white beach and roaring turquoise waves,\r\nCopacabana is set off by dozens of fashionable restaurants and bars at which\r\nyou are bound to find the perfect way to while away an afternoon and evening.&nbsp; Completely at odds with Rio and Copacabana,\r\nand displaying the diverse lifestyles and cultures which exist alongside one\r\nanother in Brazil, is somewhere such as Boca da Valeria.&nbsp; Located close to the basin of the Amazon\r\nRiver, Boca da Valeria is a rainforest paradise which is almost completely\r\nunchanged by the rapid growth and expansion of Brazil’s global profile.&nbsp; Here, you can witness the lifestyle of\r\nAmazonian natives for whom the village of Boca da Valeria is a source of pride\r\nas well as the site of simple living.&nbsp;\r\nThe gateway city to the Amazon is the capital of the Amazonas province,\r\nManaus where you can admire the famous Teatro Amazonas, a magnificent 100 year\r\nold opera house set in one of the most stunning geographical locations in the\r\nworld.&nbsp; From here you can also visit the\r\nLake Janauri Ecological Park where it is possible to take canoe tours through\r\nthe igapos (flooded forests) and dry land forests.&nbsp; For yet another side of multifaceted Brazil,\r\nNatal, the capital of Rio Grande Norte, sits of the Atlantic and is a city of\r\ndunes.&nbsp; Take a camel ride along the\r\ncoastal dunes, visit the fascinating Forte dos Reis Magos which dates back to\r\nthe 16<sup>th</sup> century and learn about the history of the area, and visit\r\nthe world’s largest cashew tree! As with the rest of Brazil, there is something\r\nfor everyone in the sandy city of Natal.</p></p><p></p>\r\n","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"70ef04ff-064c-4096-b4e0-2cff768b607a","Slug":"a-quiet-flame-by-philip-kerr","Title":"A Quiet

Founded in 1630, Boston\r\nhas one of the longest histories in America, and has been the site of many a\r\nhistorically significant event, including most famously of course, the Boston\r\nTea Party in 1773.&nbsp; For history buffs,\r\nBoston is a treasure trove of delights, but it can also be a treat for those\r\nless historically minded, being not only a beacon of the past but also a 21<sup>st</sup>\r\ncentury city set firmly in the cosmopolitan present. If you tire of the city,\r\nthen do as the privileged urban dwellers do and explore the regions of Rhode\r\nIsland, Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket; playground of America’s\r\nultra-rich.&nbsp; With the mansions of Newport\r\nRI, to gaze adoringly at, as well as those of the Vineyard and on Nantucket,\r\nit’s easy to forget the equally rich literary pedigree that this part of\r\nAmerica’s coastline boasts.&nbsp; The\r\nsprawling homes of Newport have been most famously depicted in the works of\r\nsuch esteemed writers as Henry James and Edith Wharton, whilst Nantucket is the\r\nisland Herman Melville’s most famous character Ishmael sets off from in <i>Moby Dick</i>.&nbsp; More recently, Martha’s Vineyard provides the\r\nsetting for the novel by Liza Klaussman <i>Tigers\r\nin Red Weather</i>, and New York of course has been both the literary and\r\ncinematic backdrop for too many novels and films to even begin to count.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When visiting the stunning coastline, and archipelagos of\r\nEastern Canada, you’ll have the opportunity to jump into the storybook land of\r\nPrince Edward Island, made famous by the Anne of Green Gables children’s\r\nbooks.&nbsp; The cities of Halifax in Nova\r\nScotia and Quebec City in the province of Quebec are also yours to explore and take\r\ndelight in.&nbsp; Each as scenic as the other,\r\nHalifax is a cosmopolitan, college coastal town with a stunning harbor, whilst\r\nQuebec City boasts French flair and the famous Château Frontenac; one of the\r\nmost photographed hotels in the world.&nbsp; Heading\r\nnorth up Canada’s Atlantic coast the dramatic landscape offers cliff top\r\nlighthouses, fjords, and if it’s the right season, the chance to whale\r\nwatch.&nbsp; Lunenburg in Nova Scotia provides\r\na stunning backdrop for a spot of time travel, a place where you can meander\r\nthrough the town’s streets whilst marvelling at the historic architecture, and revelling\r\nin the feeling that you’ve found a hidden gem in this corner of the world.&nbsp; Better known to the rest of the world, but\r\nas equally exciting and enchanting is Montreal, the urban and hip heart of\r\nQuebec, where you’re as likely to meet an off kilter indie rock band member, as\r\nyou are a fellow tourist.&nbsp; With pastries\r\nas good as those you’d find in Paris, you can stuff your stomachs, whilst\r\nroving the cobbled streets and taking in the continental charm of a city which\r\nis stuffed full of characterful culture and centuries of history.&nbsp; Montreal is so continental in atmosphere and\r\nthat certain <i>je ne c’est</i> <i>quoi</i> you may forget you’re still walking\r\non North American soil, but if you do, the vast and typically North American\r\nvistas that can be seen from the City’s highest spots will remind of which\r\ncontinent you’re in.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"5d2067b7-e803-4c77-b78a-eba61c4b3bf4","Slug":"anne-of-green-gables-by-l-m-montgomery","Title":"Anne of Green Gables","Author":"L.M.

To\r\ncall Fraser Island idyllic doesn’t even do the world’s largest sand island\r\nalmost ethereal beauty.&nbsp; Unlike anywhere\r\nelse in the world, Fraser Island takes the concept of ‘paradise’ to a whole\r\nother level.&nbsp; Other worldly sand dunes\r\nrise above lakes and waterways and pristine white sand is fringed by swaying\r\npalms as dolphins, whales (if you’re there in the right season), turtles and\r\nsharks call the waters off the island home, although you certainly shouldn’t as\r\nit has an absolutely lethal undertow.&nbsp; If\r\nall that perfect paradisiacal living on Fraser Island still isn’t enough for\r\nyou, head to the Whitsunday Islands, which is widely considered to play host to\r\nQueensland’s most beautiful beach (which is saying something), Whitehaven.&nbsp; A white-sand, tropical archipelago, set off\r\nby crystal clear azure water which offers some of the finest diving and\r\nsnorkeling in the world, the Whitsundays also offer a social and ecological\r\nconscious, with many of the islands almost entirely taken over by National\r\nParks intent on conservation, and most of the resorts committed to\r\nenvironmental protection and preservation.&nbsp;\r\nPort Douglas makes for a good spot from which to explore this land of\r\nrivers, rainforest and raging Pacific surf, a small town which has more of a\r\nvillage feel to it despite the hordes of tourists who descend on the lively\r\nconurbation to discover the likes of Mossman Gorge, the Daintree Rainforest and\r\nthe dazzling underwater theme park of the Great Barrier Reef.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Western Australia give in to the seductive\r\nbeauty of such wonderfully livable cities as Broome and Perth, where the\r\ntypical laid back lifestyle of Australia combines with ubiquitous natural beauty\r\nand an astounding capacity for outdoor living.&nbsp;\r\nBroome has beaches upon beaches, as well as truly wild wildlife and\r\nsticky swamps within driving distance of the city making it something of a\r\nmecca for nature lovers.&nbsp; Famous for its\r\npearls, you can visit the Willie Creek Pearl Farm where you can learn about\r\nthese luxurious exports and the fascinating intricacies of the trade in\r\nthem.&nbsp; The real pearl in Broome’s\r\nlandscape is the mysterious and mystical ‘staircase to the moon’ which during\r\nsunset when you can see mudflats of Roebuck Bay at low tide, making them appear\r\nto the naked eye as a set of stairs reaching up to the moon.&nbsp; For those lucky enough to witness this visual\r\ntrick of the eye and land, it is something you are not likely to forget in a\r\nhurry.&nbsp; Broome is where the desert meets\r\nthe sea in Western Australia, and as such it would simply be rude to leave\r\nwithout indulging in a camel ride across the sand of Cable Beach. The city\r\nitself is a buzzing, bustling cosmopolitan pearl in itself, with a dedication\r\nto diversity and inclusivity as well as vibrant art, restaurant and music\r\nscenes which all combine to make this an eminently enjoyable place to spend any\r\namount of time, although you would be forgiven for wanting to stay longer than\r\noriginally anticipated.&nbsp; Perth is\r\nAustralia’s most isolated capital city, but it remains a cosmopolitan jewel in\r\nWestern Australia’s crown.&nbsp; Frenetic,\r\nfrantic, rushed off its feet and falling all over itself to compete in the rat\r\nrace it may not be, but why, exactly, is that a bad thing? This is city which\r\nnot only relishes its down time and leisure activity but views it as a\r\ncity-wide right.&nbsp; It’s all about the laid\r\nback vibe in Perth; the saunter and the wander rather than the mad cap rush and\r\ndizzying dash to the finish line.&nbsp; This\r\nis a city in which to take the directive of ‘walk, don’t run’ very seriously\r\nindeed, unless of course you’re running to get the last sun lounger on the\r\nbeach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Auckland is New Zealand’s largest city and\r\na great introduction to the country.&nbsp; Known\r\nas the ‘City of Sails’ this is a town dedicated to spending as much time as\r\npossible out on the ocean waves and this much is obvious from the dozens and\r\ndozens of sail boats which constantly dot the horizon of this fine harbor city.&nbsp; This is also the most cosmopolitan and\r\ndiverse of New Zealand’s cities, with a large Asian and Polynesian population\r\nwhich makes for great fusion cuisine, a buzzing restaurant scene and a hip and\r\nurban cultural heart which isn’t found in most other parts of this country.&nbsp; On New Zealand’s South Island head for the\r\nwild waterways and uninhabited wilderness of the Fiordland National Park, where\r\nyou can experience the deep stillness and immense quietude of Doubtless and\r\nDusky Sound, relish in the solitude of such unspoiled, natural beauty and be\r\ncontinually awe inspired by views, vistas and images almost too stunning to be\r\ncaptured on camera.&nbsp; Also in Fiordland is\r\nMilford Sound, where densely forested mountain sides spring up, miraculously\r\nfrom the edge of the still, glassy, glacier lakes.&nbsp; For a spot of city living in South Island,\r\nDunedin offers up a laid back attitude to life, in large part due to its\r\ncompact size and its large population of students.&nbsp; Dunedin was first settled by Scottish\r\nimmigrants, and this heritage is still felt and most obviously seen in the\r\ncity’s architecture but can be learned about in greater detail at the Otago\r\nSettlers Museum.&nbsp; For a truly\r\nunforgettable experience take the train ride of a lifetime along the Taieri\r\nRiver from which you will be able to see New Zealand farmland, and stunning\r\nviews of the countryside as the train makes its way through the spectacularly\r\nscenic Taieri River Gorge.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still building it’s self up from the\r\ndevastating earthquake of 2011, Christchurch is well worth a visit to witness\r\nits tenacity and resolve, as well as the beauty which still resides there and\r\ncan be found quite easily once you look past the city’s attempts to restore,\r\nrebuild and reinvigorate.&nbsp; Christchurch,\r\nwhich has always been the most traditional and heritage-aware of New Zealand’s\r\nmini-metropolises has had to change and transform rapidly, to decisively and\r\nbravely accept its fate as a brave new 21<sup>st</sup> century city dedicated\r\nto facing the future with a nobility, grace and verve that is truly\r\ninspiring.&nbsp; Exploring the ruggedly\r\nbeautiful landscape surrounding Marlborough and Nelson and within easy distance\r\nof Christchurch is pure pleasure.&nbsp; From\r\nthe snow-capped summits, to the picturesque inlets and bays, to the world class\r\nwine, this area of South Island is simply a winner.&nbsp; Reveling in the simple life, Nelson is a\r\ncreative, buzzy hub of artists and artistic sympathizers who just want to bask\r\nin the marvelous way of life which has created such a charming town.&nbsp; You can tramp through the country’s most\r\npopular National Park of Abel Tasman, spend the day on the beautiful beach at Kaiteriteri,\r\nand top it all off by sipping on a locally produced crisp, white Sauvignon\r\nwhilst watching the sun set over the ethereally beautiful and eerily stunning\r\nFarewell Spit; New Zealand’s Land’s End.</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"17e28ffc-cd53-417a-9a05-765e32368409","Slug":"a-town-like-alice-by-neil-shute","Title":"A Town Like Alice","Author":"Neil

Scott and\r\nZelda Fitzgerald, to the docked yachts of P.Diddy and Rihanna.&nbsp; Be sure to pop into Le Club 55, a\r\ndelightfully retro hangout which will transport you back to the heady days of\r\nBrigitte Bardot when she spent time in the area and at this particular bar\r\nwhilst filming <i>And God Created Women</i>\r\nduring the 1950s.&nbsp; Cannes, of course, is\r\nfamous for its film festival but is a treat for travelers throughout the year;\r\nshop on La Croisette, visit the Palais de Festivals or tour the sweet smelling\r\nMolinard perfumerie founded in 1849.&nbsp; Away\r\nfrom the crowds, but still maintaining that typically French flair are seaside\r\ntowns such as Sanary-sur-Mer in the South East of the country, where you can\r\nexplore the area in relative peace and quiet, whilst lapping up the sun and the\r\natmosphere at your leisure.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dreams of\r\nItaly are probably what bring most travelers to the Mediterranean, fulfilling\r\nas it does the quintessential vision of the Mediterranean.&nbsp; Long, sunny days punctuated by a sleepy\r\nsiesta, gelato eaten after a delectable dinner, whilst indulging in the typical\r\npassegiata around the town square or along the seafront…&nbsp; Henry James and E.M. Forster knew what they\r\nwere talking about when they wrote about the British and American obsession\r\nwith visiting Italy at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and the country\r\nhas lost none of its allure in the interim.&nbsp;\r\nNaples is a must for any die hard Pizza lover, being the birthplace of\r\none of the world’s favorite dishes, but not far from that busy, bustling\r\nmetropolis are the havens of Sorrento, Capri and Ischia.&nbsp; Sorrento lies on the cliffs above the\r\nMediterranean, an ice-cream colored dream of a seaside town from which you can\r\nvisit the ruins of volcano-destroyed Pompeii.&nbsp;\r\nCapri and Ischia are vacationing idylls, set like jewels in the\r\nMediterranean, offering themselves up as island playgrounds for their summer\r\nvisitors. Capri is the more famous of the two, but Ischia’s profile has been\r\ngrowing in recent years as visitors try to find some relief from the crowds on the\r\never popular Capri.&nbsp; Italy has no\r\nshortage of picturesque seaside towns and villages, from Portofino nestled up\r\nnear Genoa in the North West of the country, to the less well known towns to\r\nthe South and on the Eastern coast.&nbsp;\r\nBari, and the area surrounding it in the South are a popular spot due to\r\nthe Summer heat and stunning medieval architecture of the town.&nbsp; You can also take a tour to the town of\r\nAlberobello, famous&nbsp; for the trulli\r\nhouses which have been declared a UNESCO world heritage site. Amalfi and\r\nBrindisi are also packed with medieval, Mediterranean architectural\r\ndelights.&nbsp; Up in the North East, sat on\r\nthe Adriatic Sea, Ravenna will delight and charm you with the 1,400 year old\r\nchurch, the Basilica di San Vitale providing one of the finest examples of\r\nRoman architecture and art in the country.&nbsp;\r\nAnd no trip to Italy and the Mediterranean would be complete without a\r\nvisit to Venice, where you can swap the cruise ship for a gondola and indulge\r\nin a gelato whilst strolling through the Piazza di San Marco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An\r\nincreasingly popular destination, and described as the ‘pearl of the Adriatic’\r\nis the coast of Croatia and in particular the town of Dubrovnik.&nbsp; Here you can walk the 1.2 miles of city walls\r\nwhich encase the seaside city and provide simply stunning views of the\r\nsea.&nbsp; Further to the north of the\r\npristine Renaissance city is the Roman settlement of Split which has one of the\r\nbest preserved Roman palaces in the world in the form of the UNESCO world\r\nheritage site the Diocletian Palace.&nbsp; Not\r\ntoo far off the coast of Split lie the idyllic islands of Hvar and Korcula,\r\nboth of which are stylish and popular spots for yachters, as well as European\r\nvacationers.&nbsp; They may have lost\r\nsomething of their ‘secret destination’ appeal, but they are nonetheless as\r\nbeautiful and charming as ever. Fresh seafood abounds as you would expect from\r\nthe former fishing towns which now cater more to tourists.&nbsp; With azure, crystal clear waters the beaches\r\nof these two islands are like something out of a dream, and it’s worth noting\r\nthat it’s possible to take water taxis to less crowded, more secretive coves\r\nand beaches on some of the surrounding smaller islands off the coast of both\r\nHvar and Korcula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkey is\r\nnothing short of a feast for the senses.&nbsp;\r\nThe country is a meeting point and melting pot of West and East and\r\nnowhere is this more obvious than in the city on the Bosphorus; Istanbul.&nbsp; Istanbul is like nowhere on Earth, literally\r\nbridging as it does the land masses of Europe and Asia, it is possible to lose\r\nyourself in the culture and past of a city which has been the site of so much\r\nchange and history.&nbsp; You might literally\r\nlose yourself in the Bazaars, where you can barter for spices, rugs, jewelry\r\nand leather goods.&nbsp; Visiting the Hagia\r\nSophia is a must in Istanbul, as is viewing it from afar, so as to properly\r\nappreciate the architecture of this stunning building which has had as many\r\npast lives as a Church and as a Mosque as the city of Istanbul itself has\r\nhad.&nbsp; If there’s time, a trip to the Prince’s\r\nIslands in the Bosphorus is a real treat especially for anyone made tired by\r\nthe sheer bustle and busyness of the city.&nbsp;\r\nMarmaris is also a popular vacationing spot in Turkey, and will provide\r\nsome much needed rest and relaxtion either after the hustle and bustle of\r\nIstanbul’s bazaars, or in order to prepare you for it.&nbsp; Settle down with a book and a cocktail on the\r\nbeach, wander the narrow streets of the Greek Revival Old Quarter in town, or\r\nset off on a super scuba diving trip.&nbsp;\r\nThe island of Antalya will awe you with its dense forest, and just as\r\ndense and vibrant history.&nbsp; Like the rest\r\nof Turkey, the town has a surfeit of history and both regional and national\r\nhistory can be explored at the excellent Antalya Archeological Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greece is\r\nwell known as the home of democracy, as well as of souvlaki, doldades, ouzo,\r\nand Kalamata olives; it’s up to you decide which is the most important to you\r\nwhen vacationing in this fascinating country!&nbsp;\r\nAthens, of course is the obvious place to start a tour of this ancient\r\ncountry, with tours of the Acropolis and the National Archeological Museum a\r\nmust-do for all visitors.&nbsp; There’s\r\nshopping and sightseeing a-plenty in this cosmopolitan city, and you may want\r\nsome peace and quiet after such an invigorating metropolitan experience, in\r\nwhich case the islands of Greece surely will not disappoint.&nbsp; Mykonos has long been a favorite of island\r\nhoppers and tourists, the famously whitewashed walls of the city shimmer in the\r\nsun as you wander through the streets, and accordingly the beach beckons for a\r\nday of sunbathing and refreshing dips in the water, interspersed by the\r\ndelicious local cuisine for lunch and dinner. Santorini keeps visitors coming\r\nback year after year, its heady location and stunning weather matched only by\r\nthe winning local architecture of white buildings topped by blue domed roofs,\r\nmaking the view of the town one of the most iconic vistas in all of\r\nEurope.&nbsp; The island of Rhodes has its\r\nvery own acropolis as well as some of the most stunning Ancient Greek\r\narchitecture you are likely to come across, including the Castle of&nbsp; Monolithis&nbsp;\r\ndating back to 1480 as well as the very grandly named the Palace of the\r\nGrand Master of the Knights of Rhodes from the 14<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; The more rugged Skopelos, which means ‘cliff’\r\nin Greek is also a wonderful spot to get to know the Grecian way of life.&nbsp; With beautiful white sand beaches, beach\r\nfront bars and tavernas, and an abundance of natural beauty, Skopelos has\r\nsomething for everyone.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To describe\r\nthe city of Larnaca in Cyprus as ancient would be something of an\r\nunderstatement.&nbsp; Even the main city\r\nstreets date back to the 17<sup>th</sup> century, and there are ruins from as\r\nfar back as the ancient Greek settlement of the town in the 14<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury.&nbsp; Many of the ruins of the\r\nancient city of Kitium close by to Larnaca are from the 13<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury; this is a town with history around every corner and where every street\r\nand wall tells a story.&nbsp; Close to the\r\ncenter of the town is the stunning Orthodox Church of Lazarus, said to be built\r\nover the tomb of Lazarus and with breathtaking marble walls within which you\r\ncan perhaps find some relief from the heat, as well as revel in the beauty of\r\nthe building.&nbsp; One of the biggest draws\r\nto the area, especially for divers, is the mysterious case of the wreck of the\r\nZenobia, a Swiss ferry which sank off the coast of Larnaca with no apparent\r\ncause.&nbsp; The port city of Limassol is also\r\nrife with ancient ruins and an absolute dream for history buffs and architecture\r\naficionados.&nbsp; The Paphos Archeaological\r\nSite is a UNESCO World Heritage&nbsp; Site,\r\nwith beautifully well preserved mosaics and subterranean colonnades in the\r\nHouses of Dionysus and Orpheus.&nbsp; The\r\nByzantine Castle is also well worth a visit as it comprises of the castle\r\nitself, where Richard the Lionheart is said to have wed, as well as an\r\neducational and fascinating museum.&nbsp; In\r\naddition to these two treasures are the Greco-Roman ruins at Kourion and\r\nAmathus, which includes an ancient theater, Roman baths, the House of the\r\nGladiators and the Temple of Aphrodite.&nbsp;\r\nIn Paphos you are able to combine all the charm of the Cyprus seaside\r\nwith a beautiful day at the beach followed with a tour of several historically\r\nsignificant archeological ruins including the Tombs of the King and the Paphos\r\nOdeon.&nbsp; Paphos is also mythically\r\nsignificant by way of being the birthplace of Goddess Aphrodite. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p></p>\r\n","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"c0ce0f24-b137-43ad-83c6-9d3ae08cf6d1","Slug":"a-room-with-a-view-by-e-m-forster","Title":"A Room with a View","Author":"E.M.

This\r\nis a great spot to try out a more sophisticated and cosmopolitan side of the\r\nBlack Sea and Bulgaria, you’ll be spoilt by the choice of cafes, bars and\r\nrestaurants as well as museums, galleries and a particularly enticing Roman\r\nBaths complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Ukraine, Odessa is one of the Black\r\nSea’s finest port of calls, with truly stunning Baroque and Rococo pre-Soviet\r\narchitecture to whet your architectural appetite as well as regional culinary\r\ndelights to sate your epicurean curiosity.&nbsp;\r\nThe Privoz Market is a great place to start with the latter, where\r\nthere’s more than just produce on offer, but where you can certainly pick up\r\nsome local curiosities and treats such as caviar.&nbsp; It’s worth taking a stroll through the Old\r\nTown which has been restored in recent years in order to honor and pay tribute\r\nto the city’s history and fascinating past.&nbsp;\r\nStart with Deribasovskaya Street, gorgeous tree-lined avenue which is\r\nsure to get you in the mood for some serious sightseeing.&nbsp; The Opera House is a Rococo and Baroque\r\nmasterpiece, having been rebuilt in 1873 after a devastating fire and even if\r\nyou don’t get the chance to attend an opera, a tour of the luxurious interior\r\nprovides fantastic insight into the history of this pleasantly glamorous and\r\nstately city.&nbsp; Yalta is most famous for\r\nthe role the city played in the post-WWII conference in 1945, and it’s possible\r\nto visit the rooms at Livadia Palace where the meeting of Churchill, Roosevelt\r\nand Stalin took place.&nbsp; Perched like a\r\nrichly decorated wedding cake over the Black Sea is The Swallow’s Nest Castle\r\nwhich was initially built to be a summer cottage for the Russian Tsar, and has\r\nstunning views over the Black Sea sat as it is 40 meters above the water.&nbsp; Yalta is as rich in natural beauty as it is\r\nin royal history and regal palaces.&nbsp;\r\nSurrounded by the Crimean Mountains, it is now possible to hike the path\r\nfrom the Livadia Palace to the Swallow’s Nest that the Romanovs would have\r\nwalked when in need of a spot of fresh air and a bracing cliff side\r\nstroll.&nbsp; Yalta also retains its upmarket\r\nappeal despite no longer being the home to Russia’s royals, and with stylish\r\nrestaurants and cafes lining the promenade it is easy to see why it is still\r\nsuch a popular summer spot for tourists and vacationers.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Turkey’s Black Sea coast lies the\r\nhistorically significant port of Trabzon, which was once a crucial stop on the\r\nfamous Silk Road, forming a meeting point for various religions, languages and\r\ncultures which has gone into making the town a true melting pot.&nbsp; As a visitor you will be enthused and\r\nenthralled by the town’s history and thoroughly infected with the atmospheric\r\nmix of cultures and cultural infusions.&nbsp;\r\nThe city once served as the trade gateway to the East and as such prides\r\nitself on its past and varied history; there is much to see and do here,\r\ndespite being less busy or populous than it once was.&nbsp; Popular tourist spots include the Trabzon\r\nMuseum, Ataturk’s Villa, the Sumela Monastery which was hewn into the side of a\r\ncliff, and the Hagia Sophia Museum.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"c3b80603-a8ea-4f86-9a9f-a7679748be28","Slug":"birds-without-wings-by-louis-de-bernieres","Title":"Birds Without

Skagen and\r\nHelsingor - which was immortalized as the setting of Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet</i> - in the North of the country are\r\nalso two great Scandinavian towns not to be missed.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denmark and Sweden are in fact conjoined by\r\nthe bridge made famous in another Nordic crime thriller, <i>The Bridge</i> that connects Copenhagen to the Swedish city of\r\nMalmo.&nbsp; Malmo is an ever expanding city,\r\nwith a Museum of Modern Art to tempt you, as well as a vast array of culinary\r\nadventures, rustic restaurants, and cozy cafes to indulge in the Swedish\r\ntradition of Fika: that’s coffee, cake and a well-earned rest to the\r\nuninitiated.&nbsp; Another spot well worth a\r\nvisit in Southern Sweden is Ystad, a beautiful historic town with candy colored\r\nmedieval buildings and quaintly cobblestoned streets and alleyways.&nbsp; It is also, however, home to the fictional\r\ndetective Kurt Wallander in Henning Mankell’s series of crime novels and has\r\nsince been immortalized onscreen in both Swedish and British TV adaptations of\r\nthe novels, and if you’re a real fan, it’s possible to take a Wallander tour of\r\nthe town.&nbsp; Sweden’s 700 year old capital\r\ncity Stockholm positively teems with history, culture, style and architectural\r\nbeauty as well as a stunning natural setting on 14 islands set in the Baltic\r\nSea.&nbsp; With royal palaces, the charming\r\nold town known as Gamla Stan, the popular neighborhoods of Ostermalm and\r\nSodermalm, as well as the wonderful open air museum Skansen there is more than\r\nenough, in fact too much, to keep you busy in Stockholm.&nbsp; For a quieter side of the city, a boat trip\r\nto and around the archipelagos which surround the city make for a charming and\r\ncalming alternative to sightseeing in the cosmopolitan center.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sweden’s neighboring Norway is one of the\r\nmost popular countries from which to view the fabled Northern Lights, or Aurora\r\nBorealis.&nbsp; Tromso in the far north of the\r\ncountry can be visited by all those hoping to see the dancing lights drift\r\nacross the night sky in a truly ethereal experience that is sure to leave you\r\nboth breathless and with some stunningly beautiful memories.&nbsp; Natural beauty abounds in and around Tromso,\r\nwith the town surrounded by mountains, fjords, and the water dotted with islands.&nbsp; There is also some interesting architecture\r\nto view in Tromso, most particularly the Arctic Cathedral which houses the\r\nlargest and most northerly stained glass windows in Europe; they are also\r\nperfect for viewing the Midnight Sun through if visiting in the summer\r\nmonths.&nbsp; Bergen in Western Norway is a\r\npopular destination for those wishing to explore the legendary Nordic fjords\r\nbut it’s a great spot to visit regardless of whether you are planning a trip to\r\nthe fjords.&nbsp; A historic jewel in a\r\nmagnificent setting there is some great hiking in the mountains surrounding the\r\ncity which is also the second largest in Norway.&nbsp; In the south of the country, and near the\r\nborder with Sweden is the capital city of Oslo which, because this is Norway\r\nand it’s near impossible to get away from, is situated on the shores of a\r\nfjord.&nbsp; Like Stockholm and Copenhagen,\r\nOslo is a truly Nordic cosmopolitan city with a vast number of attractions to\r\nrecommend it.&nbsp; Unique to Oslo, however,\r\nis the ready availability of outdoor pursuits making this a remarkably active\r\ncity to spend time in; swim in the fjord in the summer, hike in the surrounding\r\nforests, or indulge in some cross-country skiing in the winter.&nbsp; There are also tons of opportunities for\r\nisland hopping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it’s a vibrant city with a unique\r\nsetting you’re after, then Reykjavík is the spot for you.&nbsp; A city famed for its warm welcome,\r\ncosmopolitan lifestyle, local cuisine and, most crucially, its hot springs\r\nthose who visit this charming northern city keep coming back for more.&nbsp; The first stop on most travelers’ visits to\r\nIceland is the Blue Lagoon, a magical geothermal natural bath in the middle of\r\na lava field which has provided the backdrop for many a dramatic photo shoot,\r\nand could now provide the perfect backdrop for your introduction to\r\nIceland.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can expect to be stunned by truly awesome\r\nnatural wonders such as this at every turn in incredible Iceland, a country so\r\nunique it has to be seen to be believed.&nbsp;</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"f5706225-fdfd-4edc-867b-eb10b9af3ef1","Slug":"black-skies-by-arnaldur-indridason","Title":"Black

the eight, stunningly beautiful volcanic islands which\r\nmake up the area known as Hawaii, there is something to charm and enchant\r\nanyone and everyone.&nbsp; Known for years as\r\na top honeymoon getaway spot, the sheer natural beauty and seductive lifestyle\r\nof the area keeps honeymooners coming back for more year in and year out, until,\r\nin fact, it’s time to celebrate their ruby wedding anniversaries.&nbsp; There’s a spot on one of these eight islands\r\nfor everyone, whether you’re a geological enthusiast, desperate to climb an\r\nactive volcano, a sun worshipper happy to sip pina coladas under the azure\r\nskies on the shore of the Pacific Ocean, a thrill seeker searching for that\r\nperfect wave, or a happy couple looking for a bit of idyllic privacy far from\r\nthe maddening crowds of civilization.&nbsp;\r\nWhatever your bliss when you’re in Hawaii you’ll be sure to hear the\r\nfollowing words more than once; Welcome to paradise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some, paradise is Honolulu, the state capital found on\r\nthe island of Oahu and the home to state’s largest confluence of shops,\r\nrestaurants, cafes, bars and hotels.&nbsp; It\r\nis, of course, also home to stunning stretches of sandy beach, as well as the\r\nhistorically famous Pearl Harbor, site of the bombing by the Japanese which\r\nserved as the catalyst to the USA joining the war effort in World War II.&nbsp; The USS Arizona Memorial can be visited by\r\nthose wishing to pay their respects to those who lost their lives that day, and\r\nis visited by over 1 million visitors a year wishing to do just that, as well\r\nas educate themselves on both the Pearl Harbor attack and the US’s involvement\r\nin the war that followed.&nbsp; Most visitors\r\nto Hawaii flock to the warm waters of Waikiki and the hotels and restaurants\r\nwhich line the southern shore of the island.&nbsp;\r\nWaikiki is the perfect destination for those hoping to get to know the\r\nisland, perfectly positioned as it is close to not only Pearl Harbor, but\r\nIolani Palace, Nuuanu Pali Lookout, Hanauma Bay, as well as the Honolulu Zoo\r\nand Waikiki Aquarium and Historical Trail which aims to educate tourists and\r\nvisitors about the history of the area, and in particular the invention and\r\nhistory of surfing which happened in the waters of Waikiki.&nbsp; For those who fancy a hike,&nbsp; culminating in panoramic vistas of the\r\nsouthern tip of Oahu island, then the not-too-challenging climb to the top of\r\nDiamond Head, or Leahi as its known in Hawaiian is the best bet, especially on\r\na fine day – which is most days in Hawaii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stopping off a Lahaina on the island of Maui often means\r\nbeing tethered offshore, giving you a prime view of the&nbsp; island and the charming sea port of Lahaina\r\nwhich has a rich history stretching back to the whaling days, when Herman\r\nMelville would have served as one of the island’s visitors.&nbsp; Now, you’re much more likely to come across\r\nhappy tourists promenading along the sea front, dropping into art galleries,\r\nsipping on lattes or the occasional chilled beer, and sampling the local\r\ncuisine.&nbsp; In the past two decades there\r\nhas been something of an epicurean revolution in Hawaii, widely known as the\r\nHawaii Regional Cuisine movement, started by 12 local chefs, three of whom have\r\nrestaurants on Maui where they serve up the freshest of fish, local produce and\r\nveggies grown in upcountry Maui, and beef from cattle raised on island’s upland\r\npastures.&nbsp; There is often an Asian twist\r\nand influence to the cooking, creating a unique take on some classic American\r\ndishes.&nbsp; A meal at one of these famed\r\nrestaurants such as Haliimaile General Store, Merriman’s Kapalua or Mala Ocean\r\nTavern is a local experience not to be missed.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visiting the smaller, quieter island of Kauai can feel like\r\nstepping back in time.&nbsp; Youwon’t find any\r\nof the large resorts, restaurants or tour operators as on Honolulu or Maui,\r\ninstead there’s just unspoilt wilderness and the tiny, picturesque towns of Old\r\nKoloa and Hanapepe.&nbsp; Both towns have been\r\nbeautifully maintained in the plantation style Kauai is traditionally famous\r\nfor, but been given the most subtle and gentle of modern makeovers, so that the\r\nplantation houses now house general stores, cute boutiques, and local art\r\ngalleries.&nbsp; From Hanapepe and Koloa be\r\nsure to explore the rest of the island, which serves as a treasure trove of\r\nnature and wildlife for enthusiasts to “ooh” and “aah” over.&nbsp; The sheer rock face delving down into the\r\nPacific depths of the Napali coast will shock and awe inspire even the most\r\ncynical travellers who think they’ve already seen it all, and if Napali doesn’t\r\ndo the trick, then the largest canyon in the Pacific, Waimea Canyon should\r\nscore some points.&nbsp; It may not be as\r\nlarge as the Grand Canyon in the continental US, but the crowds are fewer, and\r\nthere’s nothing quite like watching the sunrise over a Hawaiian canyon.</p></p>","Gallery":{"Tombstones":[],"Images":[]},"TravelBooks":[{"Id":"e0db0833-e199-425b-8278-2137780ccc2d","Slug":"democracy-by-joan-didion","Title":"Democracy","Author":"Joan
